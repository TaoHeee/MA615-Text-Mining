1448 "INTRODUCTION"
1448 ""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Heidi\" is a delightful story for children of life in the Alps,"
1448 "one of many tales written by the Swiss authoress, Johanna Spyri,"
1448 "who died in her home at Zurich in 1891. She had been well known"
1448 "to the younger readers of her own country since 1880, when she"
1448 "published her story, Heimathlos, which ran into three or more"
1448 "editions, and which, like her other books, as she states on the"
1448 "title page, was written for those who love children, as well as"
1448 "for the youngsters themselves. Her own sympathy with the"
1448 "instincts and longings of the child's heart is shown in her"
1448 "picture of Heidi. The record of the early life of this Swiss"
1448 "child amid the beauties of her passionately loved mountain-home"
1448 "and during her exile in the great town has been for many years a"
1448 "favorite book of younger readers in Germany and America."
1448 ""
1448 "Madame Spyri, like Hans Andersen, had by temperament a peculiar"
1448 "skill in writing the simple histories of an innocent world. In"
1448 "all her stories she shows an underlying desire to preserve"
1448 "children alike from misunderstanding and the mistaken kindness"
1448 "that frequently hinder the happiness and natural development of"
1448 "their lives and characters. The authoress, as we feel in reading"
1448 "her tales, lived among the scenes and people she describes, and"
1448 "the setting of her stories has the charm of the mountain scenery"
1448 "amid which she places her small actors."
1448 ""
1448 "Her chief works, besides Heidi, were:-- Am Sonntag; Arthur und"
1448 "Squirrel; Aus dem Leben; Aus den Schweizer Bergen; Aus Nah und"
1448 "Fern; Aus unserem, Lande; Cornelli wird erzogen; Einer vom Hause"
1448 "Lesa; 10 Geschichten fur Yung und Alt; Kurze Geschichten, 2"
1448 "vols.; Gritli's Kinder, 2 vols.; Heimathlos; Im Tilonethal; In"
1448 "Leuchtensa; Keiner zu Klein Helfer zu sein; Onkel Titus; Schloss"
1448 "Wildenstein; Sina; Ein Goldener Spruch; Die Hauffer Muhle;"
1448 "Verschollen, nicht vergessen; Was soll deim aus ihr werden; Was"
1448 "aus ihr Geworden ist.                                    M.E."

1448 "<CHAPTER I. UP THE MOUNTAIN TO ALM-UNCLE>"
1448 ""
1448 "From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a"
1448 "footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of"
1448 "the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and"
1448 "lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually"
1448 "wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far"
1448 "before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and"
1448 "sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly"
1448 "up to the summits above."
1448 ""
1448 "On a clear sunny morning in June two figures might be seen"
1448 "climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking"
1448 "girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and"
1448 "whose little checks were so aglow with heat that the crimson"
1448 "color could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And"
1448 "this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June"
1448 "sun the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost."
1448 "She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what"
1448 "her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for"
1448 "she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the"
1448 "other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round"
1448 "about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless"
1448 "appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed"
1448 "mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in"
1448 "the heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour's walk"
1448 "behind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which"
1448 "is situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with"
1448 "greetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some"
1448 "from open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now"
1448 "in her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to"
1448 "respond to her friends' welcoming cries and questions, but passed"
1448 "on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of"
1448 "the scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her"
1448 "from the door: \"Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher,"
1448 "I will come with you.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately"
1448 "let go her hand and seated herself on the ground."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Are you tired, Heidi?\" asked her companion."
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, I am hot,\" answered the child."
1448 ""
1448 "\"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a"
1448 "little longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour we"
1448 "shall be there,\" said Dete in an encouraging voice."
1448 ""
1448 "They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who"
1448 "walked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking"
1448 "forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and"
1448 "everything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child"
1448 "wandered behind them."
1448 ""
1448 "\"And where are you off to with the child?\" asked the one who had"
1448 "just joined the party. \"I suppose it is the child your sister"
1448 "left?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes,\" answered Dete. \"I am taking her up to Uncle, where she"
1448 "must stay.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your"
1448 "senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man,"
1448 "however, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home"
1448 "again!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather."
1448 "He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child"
1448 "till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up"
1448 "the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place,"
1448 "for her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by"
1448 "her.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"That would be all very well if he were like other people,\""
1448 "asseverated stout Barbel warmly, \"but you know what he is. And"
1448 "what can he do with a child, especially with one so young! The"
1448 "child cannot possibly live with him. But where are you thinking"
1448 "of going yourself?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"To Frankfurt, where an extra good place awaits me,\" answered"
1448 "Dete. \"The people I am going to were down at the Baths last"
1448 "summer, and it was part of my duty to attend upon their rooms."
1448 "They would have liked then to take me away with them, but I"
1448 "could not leave. Now they are there again and have repeated their"
1448 "offer, and I intend to go with them, you may make up your mind"
1448 "to that!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am glad I am not the child!\" exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture"
1448 "of horrified pity. \"Not a creature knows anything about the old"
1448 "man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never"
1448 "sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another."
1448 "When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of"
1448 "the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with"
1448 "his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming"
1448 "enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would"
1448 "care to meet him alone.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, and what of that?\" said Dete, in a defiant voice, \"he is"
1448 "the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He"
1448 "is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be"
1448 "answerable for it, not I.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I should very much like to know,\" continued Barbel, in an"
1448 "inquiring tone of voice, \"what the old man has on his conscience"
1448 "that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain"
1448 "like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds"
1448 "of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly"
1448 "have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I"
1448 "not right?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I"
1448 "heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble"
1448 "about it.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Now Barbel had for long past been most anxious to ascertain"
1448 "particulars about Alm-Uncle, as she could not understand why he"
1448 "seemed to feel such hatred towards his fellow-creatures, and"
1448 "insisted on living all alone, or why people spoke about him half"
1448 "in whispers, as if afraid to say anything against him, and yet"
1448 "unwilling to take his Part. Moreover, Barbel was in ignorance as"
1448 "to why all the people in Dorfli called him Alm-Uncle, for he"
1448 "could not possibly be uncle to everybody living there. As,"
1448 "however, it was the custom, she did like the rest and called the"
1448 "old man Uncle. Barbel had only lived in Dorfli since her"
1448 "marriage, which had taken place not long before. Previous to"
1448 "that her home had been below in Prattigau, so that she was not"
1448 "well acquainted with all the events that had ever taken place,"
1448 "and with all the people who had ever lived in Dorfli and its"
1448 "neighborhood. Dete, on the contrary, had been born in Dorfli,"
1448 "and had lived there with her mother until the death of the latter"
1448 "the year before, and had then gone over to the Baths at Ragatz"
1448 "and taken service in the large hotel there as chambermaid. On the"
1448 "morning of this day she had come all the way from Ragatz with"
1448 "the child, a friend having given them a lift in a hay-cart as far"
1448 "as Mayenfeld. Barbel was therefore determined not to lose this"
1448 "good opportunity of satisfying her curiosity. She put her arm"
1448 "through Dete's in a confidential sort of way, and said: \"I know I"
1448 "can find out the real truth from you, and the meaning of all"
1448 "these tales that are afloat about him. I believe you know the"
1448 "whole story. Now do just tell me what is wrong with the old man,"
1448 "and if he was always shunned as he is now, and was always such a"
1448 "misanthrope.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"How can I possibly tell you whether he was always the same,"
1448 "seeing I am only six-and-twenty and he at least seventy years of"
1448 "age; so you can hardly expect me to know much about his youth."
1448 "If I was sure, however, that what I tell you would not go the"
1448 "whole round of Prattigau, I could relate all kinds of things"
1448 "about him; my mother came from Domleschg, and so did he.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Nonsense, Dete, what do you mean?\" replied Barbel, somewhat"
1448 "offended, \"gossip has not reached such a dreadful pitch in"
1448 "Prattigau as all that, and I am also quite capable of holding my"
1448 "tongue when it is necessary.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Very well then, I will tell you--but just wait a moment,\" said"
1448 "Dete in a warning voice, and she looked back to make sure that"
1448 "the child was not near enough to hear all she was going to"
1448 "relate; but the child was nowhere to be seen, and must have"
1448 "turned aside from following her companions some time before,"
1448 "while these were too eagerly occupied with their conversation to"
1448 "notice it. Dete stood still and looked around her in all"
1448 "directions. The footpath wound a little here and there, but"
1448 "could nevertheless be seen along its whole length nearly to"
1448 "Dorfli; no one, however, was visible upon it at this moment."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I see where she is,\" exclaimed Barbel, \"look over there!\" and"
1448 "she pointed to a spot far away from the footpath. \"She is"
1448 "climbing up the slope yonder with the goatherd and his goats. I"
1448 "wonder why he is so late to-day bringing them up. It happens"
1448 "well, however, for us, for he can now see after the child, and"
1448 "you can the better tell me your tale.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, as to the looking after,\" remarked Dete, \"the boy need not"
1448 "put himself out about that; she is not by any means stupid for"
1448 "her five years, and knows how to use her eyes. She notices all"
1448 "that is going on, as I have often had occasion to remark, and"
1448 "this will stand her in good stead some day, for the old man has"
1448 "nothing beyond his two goats and his hut.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Did he ever have more?\" asked Barbel."
1448 ""
1448 "\"He? I should think so indeed,\" replied Dete with animation; \"he"
1448 "was owner once of one of the largest farms in Domleschg. He was"
1448 "the elder of two brothers; the younger was a quiet, orderly man,"
1448 "but nothing would please the other but to play the grand"
1448 "gentleman and go driving about the country and mixing with bad"
1448 "company, strangers that nobody knew. He drank and gambled away"
1448 "the whole of his property, and when this became known to his"
1448 "mother and father they died, one shortly after the other, of"
1448 "sorrow. The younger brother, who was also reduced to beggary,"
1448 "went off in his anger, no one knew whither, while Uncle himself,"
1448 "having nothing now left to him but his bad name, also"
1448 "disappeared. For some time his whereabouts were unknown, then"
1448 "some one found out that he had gone to Naples as a soldier;"
1448 "after that nothing more was heard of him for twelve or fifteen"
1448 "years. At the end of that time he reappeared in Domleschg,"
1448 "bringing with him a young child, whom he tried to place with some"
1448 "of his kinspeople. Every door, however, was shut in his face, for"
1448 "no one wished to have any more to do with him. Embittered by this"
1448 "treatment, he vowed never to set foot in Domleschg again, and he"
1448 "then came to Dorfli, where he continued to live with his little"
1448 "boy. His wife was probably a native of the Grisons, whom he had"
1448 "met down there, and who died soon after their marriage. He could"
1448 "not have been entirely without money, for he apprenticed his"
1448 "son, Tobias, to a carpenter. He was a steady lad, and kindly"
1448 "received by every one in Dorfli. The old man was, however, still"
1448 "looked upon with suspicion, and it was even rumoured that he had"
1448 "been forced to make his escape from Naples, or it might have gone"
1448 "badly with him, for that he had killed a man, not in fair fight,"
1448 "you understand, but in some brawl. We, however, did not refuse"
1448 "to acknowledge our relationship with him, my great-grandmother on"
1448 "my mother's side having been sister to his grandmother. So we"
1448 "called him Uncle, and as through my father we are also related to"
1448 "nearly every family in Dorfli, he became known all over the place"
1448 "as Uncle, and since he went to live on the mountain side he has"
1448 "gone everywhere by the name of Alm-Uncle.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"And what happened to Tobias?\" asked Barbel, who was listening"
1448 "with deep interest."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Wait a moment, I am coming to that, but I cannot tell you"
1448 "everything at once,\" replied Dete. \"Tobias was taught his trade"
1448 "in Mels, and when he had served his apprenticeship he came back"
1448 "to Dorfli and married my sister Adelaide. They had always been"
1448 "fond of one another, and they got on very well together after"
1448 "they were married. But their happiness did not last long. Her"
1448 "husband met with his death only two years after their marriage,"
1448 "a beam falling upon him as he was working, and killing him on the"
1448 "spot. They carried him home, and when Adelaide saw the poor"
1448 "disfigured body of her husband she was so overcome with horror"
1448 "and grief that she fell into a fever from which she never"
1448 "recovered. She had always been rather delicate and subject to"
1448 "curious attacks, during which no one knew whether she was awake"
1448 "or sleeping. And so two months after Tobias had been carried to"
1448 "the grave, his wife followed him. Their sad fate was the talk of"
1448 "everybody far and near, and both in private and public the"
1448 "general opinion was expressed that it was a punishment which"
1448 "Uncle had deserved for the godless life he had led. Some went so"
1448 "far even as to tell him so to his face. Our minister endeavored"
1448 "to awaken his conscience and exhorted him to repentance, but the"
1448 "old man grew only more wrathful and obdurate and would not speak"
1448 "to a soul, and every one did their best to keep out of his way."
1448 "All at once we heard that he had gone to live up the Alm and did"
1448 "not intend ever to come down again, and since then he has led"
1448 "his solitary life on the mountain side at enmity with God and"
1448 "man. Mother and I took Adelaide's little one, then only a year"
1448 "old, into our care. When mother died last year, and I went down"
1448 "to the Baths to earn some money, I paid old Ursel, who lives in"
1448 "the village just above, to keep and look after the child. I"
1448 "stayed on at the Baths through the winter, for as I could sew and"
1448 "knit I had no difficulty in finding plenty of work, and early in"
1448 "the spring the same family I had waited on before returned from"
1448 "Frankfurt, and again asked me to go back with them. And so we"
1448 "leave the day after to-morrow, and I can assure you, it is an"
1448 "excellent place for me.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"And you are going to give the child over to the old man up"
1448 "there? It surprises me beyond words that you can think of doing"
1448 "such a thing, Dete,\" said Barbel, in a voice full of reproach."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What do you mean?\" retorted Dete. \"I have done my duty by the"
1448 "child, and what would you have me do with it now? I cannot"
1448 "certainly take a child of five years old with me to Frankfurt."
1448 "But where are you going to yourself, Barbel; we are now half way"
1448 "up the Alm?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"We have just reached the place I wanted,\" answered Barbel. \"I"
1448 "had something to say to the goatherd's wife, who does some"
1448 "spinning for me in the winter. So good-bye, Dete, and good luck"
1448 "to you!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Dete shook hands with her friend and remained standing while"
1448 "Barbel went towards a small, dark brown hut, which stood a few"
1448 "steps away from the path in a hollow that afforded it some"
1448 "protection from the mountain wind. The hut was situated half way"
1448 "up the Alm, reckoning from Dorfli, and it was well that it was"
1448 "provided with some shelter, for it was so broken-down and"
1448 "dilapidated that even then it must have been very unsafe as a"
1448 "habitation, for when the stormy south wind came sweeping over"
1448 "the mountain, everything inside it, doors and windows, shook and"
1448 "rattled, and all the rotten old beams creaked and trembled. On"
1448 "such days as this, had the goatherd's dwelling been standing"
1448 "above on the exposed mountain side, it could not have escaped"
1448 "being blown straight down into the valley without a moment's"
1448 "warning."
1448 ""
1448 "Here lived Peter, the eleven-year-old boy, who every morning"
1448 "went down to Dorfli to fetch his goats and drive them up on to"
1448 "the mountain, where they were free to browse till evening on the"
1448 "delicious mountain plants."
1448 ""
1448 "Then Peter, with his light-footed animals, would go running and"
1448 "leaping down the mountain again till he reached Dorfli, and"
1448 "there he would give a shrill whistle through his fingers,"
1448 "whereupon all the owners of the goats would come out to fetch"
1448 "home the animals that belonged to them. It was generally the"
1448 "small boys and girls who ran in answer to Peter's whistle, for"
1448 "they were none of them afraid of the gentle goats, and this was"
1448 "the only hour of the day through all the summer months that Peter"
1448 "had any opportunity of seeing his young friends, since the rest"
1448 "of his time was spent alone with the goats. He had a mother and a"
1448 "blind grandmother at home, it is true, but he was always obliged"
1448 "to start off very early in the morning, and only got home late in"
1448 "the evening from Dorfli, for he always stayed as long as he could"
1448 "talking and playing with the other children; and so he had just"
1448 "time enough at home, and that was all, to swallow down his bread"
1448 "and milk in the morning, and again in the evening to get through"
1448 "a similar meal, lie down in bed and go to sleep. His father, who"
1448 "had been known also as the goatherd, having earned his living as"
1448 "such when younger, had been accidentally killed while cutting"
1448 "wood some years before. His mother, whose real name was Brigitta,"
1448 "was always called the goatherd's wife, for the sake of old"
1448 "association, while the blind grandmother was just \"grandmother\""
1448 "to all the old and young in the neighborhood."
1448 ""
1448 "Dete had been standing for a good ten minutes looking about her"
1448 "in every direction for some sign of the children and the goats."
1448 "Not a glimpse of them, however, was to be seen, so she climbed"
1448 "to a higher spot, whence she could get a fuller view of the"
1448 "mountain as it sloped beneath her to the valley, while, with"
1448 "ever-increasing anxiety on her face and in her movements, she"
1448 "continued to scan the surrounding slopes. Meanwhile the children"
1448 "were climbing up by a far and roundabout way, for Peter knew"
1448 "many spots where all kinds of good food, in the shape of shrubs"
1448 "and plants, grew for his goats, and he was in the habit of"
1448 "leading his flock aside from the beaten track. The child,"
1448 "exhausted with the heat and weight of her thick armor of clothes,"
1448 "panted and struggled after him at first with some difficulty. She"
1448 "said nothing, but her little eyes kept watching first Peter, as"
1448 "he sprang nimbly hither and thither on his bare feet, clad only"
1448 "in his short light breeches, and then the slim-legged goats that"
1448 "went leaping over rocks and shrubs and up the steep ascents with"
1448 "even greater ease. All at once she sat herself down on the"
1448 "ground, and as fast as her little fingers could move, began"
1448 "pulling off her shoes and stockings. This done she rose, unwound"
1448 "the hot red shawl and threw it away, and then proceeded to undo"
1448 "her frock. It was off in a second, but there was still another"
1448 "to unfasten, for Dete had put the Sunday frock on over the"
1448 "everyday one, to save the trouble of carrying it. Quick as"
1448 "lightning the everyday frock followed the other, and now the"
1448 "child stood up, clad only in her light short-sleeved under"
1448 "garment, stretching out her little bare arms with glee. She put"
1448 "all her clothes together in a tidy little heap, and then went"
1448 "jumping and climbing up after Peter and the goats as nimbly as"
1448 "any one of the party. Peter had taken no heed of what the child"
1448 "was about when she stayed behind, but when she ran up to him in"
1448 "her new attire, his face broke into a grin, which grew broader"
1448 "still as he looked back and saw the small heap of clothes lying"
1448 "on the ground, until his mouth stretched almost from ear to ear;"
1448 "he said nothing, however. The child, able now to move at her"
1448 "ease, began to enter into conversation with Peter, who had many"
1448 "questions to answer, for his companion wanted to know how many"
1448 "goats he had, where he was going to with them, and what he had to"
1448 "do when he arrived there. At last, after some time, they and the"
1448 "goats approached the hut and came within view of Cousin Dete."
1448 "Hardly had the latter caught sight of the little company climbing"
1448 "up towards her when she shrieked out: \"Heidi, what have you been"
1448 "doing! What a sight you have made of yourself! And where are your"
1448 "two frocks and the red wrapper? And the new shoes I bought, and"
1448 "the new stockings I knitted for you--everything gone! not a thing"
1448 "left! What can you have been thinking of, Heidi; where are all"
1448 "your clothes?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The child quietly pointed to a spot below on the mountain side"
1448 "and answered, \"Down there.\" Dete followed the direction of her"
1448 "finger; she could just distinguish something lying on the"
1448 "ground, with a spot of red on the top of it which she had no"
1448 "doubt was the woollen wrapper."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You good-for-nothing little thing!\" exclaimed Dete angrily,"
1448 "\"what could have put it into your head to do like that? What"
1448 "made you undress yourself? What do you mean by it?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I don't want any clothes,\" said the child, not showing any sign"
1448 "of repentance for her past deed."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You wretched, thoughtless child! have you no sense in you at"
1448 "all?\" continued Dete, scolding and lamenting. \"Who is going all"
1448 "that way down to fetch them; it's a good half-hour's walk!"
1448 "Peter, you go off and fetch them for me as quickly as you can,"
1448 "and don't stand there gaping at me, as if you were rooted to the"
1448 "ground!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am already past my time,\" answered Peter slowly, without"
1448 "moving from the spot where he had been standing with his hands"
1448 "in his pockets, listening to Dete's outburst of dismay and anger."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, you won't get far if you only keep on standing there with"
1448 "your eyes staring out of your head,\" was Dete's cross reply;"
1448 "\"but see, you shall have something nice,\" and she held out a"
1448 "bright new piece of money to him that sparkled in the sun. Peter"
1448 "was immediately up and off down the steep mountain side, taking"
1448 "the shortest cut, and in an incredibly short space of time had"
1448 "reached the little heap of clothes, which he gathered up under"
1448 "his arm, and was back again so quickly that even Dete was"
1448 "obliged to give him a word of praise as she handed him the"
1448 "promised money. Peter promptly thrust it into his pocket and his"
1448 "face beamed with delight, for it was not often that he was the"
1448 "happy possessor of such riches."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You can carry the things up for me as far as Uncle's, as you are"
1448 "going the same way,\" went on Dete, who was preparing to continue"
1448 "her climb up the mountain side, which rose in a steep ascent"
1448 "immediately behind the goatherd's hut. Peter willingly undertook"
1448 "to do this, and followed after her on his bare feet, with his"
1448 "left arm round the bundle and the right swinging his goatherd's"
1448 "stick, while Heidi and the goats went skipping and jumping"
1448 "joyfully beside him. After a climb of more than three-quarters"
1448 "of an hour they reached the top of the Alm mountain. Uncle's hut"
1448 "stood on a projection of the rock, exposed indeed to the winds,"
1448 "but where every ray of sun could rest upon it, and a full view"
1448 "could be had of the valley beneath. Behind the hut stood three"
1448 "old fir trees, with long, thick, unlopped branches. Beyond these"
1448 "rose a further wall of mountain, the lower heights still"
1448 "overgrown with beautiful grass and plants, above which were"
1448 "stonier slopes, covered only with scrub, that led gradually up"
1448 "to the steep, bare rocky summits."
1448 ""
1448 "Against the hut, on the side looking towards the valley, Uncle"
1448 "had put up a seat. Here he was sitting, his pipe in his mouth"
1448 "and his hands on his knees, quietly looking out, when the"
1448 "children, the goats and Cousin Dete suddenly clambered into view."
1448 "Heidi was at the top first. She went straight up to the old man,"
1448 "put out her hand, and said, \"Good-evening, Grandfather.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"So, so, what is the meaning of this?\" he asked gruffly, as he"
1448 "gave the child an abrupt shake of the hand, and gazed long and"
1448 "scrutinisingly at her from under his bushy eyebrows. Heidi"
1448 "stared steadily back at him in return with unflinching gaze, for"
1448 "the grandfather, with his long beard and thick grey eyebrows that"
1448 "grew together over his nose and looked just like a bush, was"
1448 "such a remarkable appearance, that Heidi was unable to take her"
1448 "eyes off him. Meanwhile Dete had come up, with Peter after her,"
1448 "and the latter now stood still a while to watch what was going"
1448 "on."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I wish you good-day, Uncle,\" said Dete, as she walked towards"
1448 "him, \"and I have brought you Tobias and Adelaide's child. You"
1448 "will hardly recognise her, as you have never seen her since she"
1448 "was a year old.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"And what has the child to do with me up here?\" asked the old"
1448 "man curtly. \"You there,\" he then called out to Peter, \"be off"
1448 "with your goats, you are none too early as it is, and take mine"
1448 "with you.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter obeyed on the instant and quickly disappeared, for the old"
1448 "man had given him a look that made him feel that he did not want"
1448 "to stay any longer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"The child is here to remain with you,\" Dete made answer. \"I"
1448 "have, I think, done my duty by her for these four years, and now"
1448 "it is time for you to do yours.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"That's it, is it?\" said the old man, as he looked at her with a"
1448 "flash in his eye. \"And when the child begins to fret and whine"
1448 "after you, as is the way with these unreasonable little beings,"
1448 "what am I to do with her then?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"That's your affair,\" retorted Dete. \"I know I had to put up"
1448 "with her without complaint when she was left on my hands as an"
1448 "infant, and with enough to do as it was for my mother and self."
1448 "Now I have to go and look after my own earnings, and you are the"
1448 "next of kin to the child. If you cannot arrange to keep her, do"
1448 "with her as you like. You will be answerable for the result if"
1448 "harm happens to her, though you have hardly need, I should think,"
1448 "to add to the burden already on your conscience.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Now Dete was not quite easy in her own conscience about what she"
1448 "was doing, and consequently was feeling hot and irritable, and"
1448 "said more than she had intended. As she uttered her last words,"
1448 "Uncle rose from his seat. He looked at her in a way that made"
1448 "her draw back a step or two, then flinging out his arm, he said"
1448 "to her in a commanding voice: \"Be off with you this instant, and"
1448 "get back as quickly as you can to the place whence you came, and"
1448 "do not let me see your face again in a hurry.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Dete did not wait to be told twice. \"Good-bye to you then, and"
1448 "to you too, Heidi,\" she called, as she turned quickly away and"
1448 "started to descend the mountain at a running pace, which she did"
1448 "not slacken till she found herself safely again at Dorfli, for"
1448 "some inward agitation drove her forwards as if a steam-engine"
1448 "was at work inside her. Again questions came raining down upon"
1448 "her from all sides, for every one knew Dete, as well as all"
1448 "particulars of the birth and former history of the child, and"
1448 "all wondered what she had done with it. From every door and"
1448 "window came voices calling: \"Where is the child?\" \"Where have you"
1448 "left the child, Dete?\" and more and more reluctantly Dete made"
1448 "answer, \"Up there with Alm-Uncle!\" \"With Alm-Uncle, have I not"
1448 "told you so already?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then the women began to hurl reproaches at her; first one cried"
1448 "out, \"How could you do such a thing!\" then another, \"To think of"
1448 "leaving a helpless little thing up there,\"--while again and"
1448 "again came the words, \"The poor mite! the poor mite!\" pursuing"
1448 "her as she went along. Unable at last to bear it any longer Dete"
1448 "ran forward as fast as she could until she was beyond reach of"
1448 "their voices. She was far from happy at the thought of what she"
1448 "had done, for the child had been left in her care by her dying"
1448 "mother. She quieted herself, however, with the idea that she"
1448 "would be better able to do something for the child if she was"
1448 "earning plenty of money, and it was a relief to her to think"
1448 "that she would soon be far away from all these people who were"
1448 "making such a fuss about the matter, and she rejoiced further"
1448 "still that she was at liberty now to take such a good place."

1448 "<CHAPTER II. AT HOME WITH GRANDFATHER>"
1448 ""
1448 "As soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back to his"
1448 "bench, and there he remained seated, staring on the ground"
1448 "without uttering a sound, while thick curls of smoke floated"
1448 "upward from his pipe. Heidi, meanwhile, was enjoying herself in"
1448 "her new surroundings; she looked about till she found a shed,"
1448 "built against the hut, where the goats were kept; she peeped in,"
1448 "and saw it was empty. She continued her search and presently"
1448 "came to the fir trees behind the hut. A strong breeze was blowing"
1448 "through them, and there was a rushing and roaring in their"
1448 "topmost branches, Heidi stood still and listened. The sound"
1448 "growing fainter, she went on again, to the farther corner of the"
1448 "hut, and so round to where her grandfather was sitting. Seeing"
1448 "that he was in exactly the same position as when she left him,"
1448 "she went and placed herself in front of the old man, and putting"
1448 "her hands behind her back, stood and gazed at him. Her"
1448 "grandfather looked up, and as she continued standing there"
1448 "without moving, \"What is it you want?\" he asked."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I want to see what you have inside the house,\" said Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Come then!\" and the grandfather rose and went before her"
1448 "towards the hut."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Bring your bundle of clothes in with you,\" he bid her as she"
1448 "was following."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I shan't want them any more,\" was her prompt answer."
1448 ""
1448 "The old man turned and looked searchingly at the child, whose"
1448 "dark eyes were sparkling in delighted anticipation of what she"
1448 "was going to see inside. \"She is certainly not wanting in"
1448 "intelligence,\" he murmured to himself. \"And why shall you not"
1448 "want them any more?\" he asked aloud."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Because I want to go about like the goats with their thin light"
1448 "legs.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, you can do so if you like,\" said her grandfather, \"but"
1448 "bring the things in, we must put them in the cupboard.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi did as she was told. The old man now opened the door and"
1448 "Heidi stepped inside after him; she found herself in a good-"
1448 "sized room, which covered the whole ground floor of the hut. A"
1448 "table and a chair were the only furniture; in one corner stood"
1448 "the grandfather's bed, in another was the hearth with a large"
1448 "kettle hanging above it; and on the further side was a large door"
1448 "in the wall--this was the cupboard. The grandfather opened it;"
1448 "inside were his clothes, some hanging up, others, a couple of"
1448 "shirts, and some socks and handkerchiefs, lying on a shelf; on a"
1448 "second shelf were some plates and cups and glasses, and on a"
1448 "higher one still, a round loaf, smoked meat, and cheese, for"
1448 "everything that Alm-Uncle needed for his food and clothing was"
1448 "kept in this cupboard. Heidi, as soon as it was opened, ran"
1448 "quickly forward and thrust in her bundle of clothes, as far back"
1448 "behind her grandfather's things as possible, so that they might"
1448 "not easily be found again. She then looked carefully round the"
1448 "room, and asked, \"Where am I to sleep, grandfather?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Wherever you like,\" he answered."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was delighted, and began at once to examine all the nooks"
1448 "and corners to find out where it would be pleasantest to sleep."
1448 "In the corner near her grandfather's bed she saw a short ladder"
1448 "against the wall; up she climbed and found herself in the"
1448 "hayloft. There lay a large heap of fresh sweet-smelling hay,"
1448 "while through a round window in the wall she could see right"
1448 "down the valley."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I shall sleep up here, grandfather,\" she called down to him,"
1448 "\"It's lovely, up here. Come up and see how lovely it is!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, I know all about it,\" he called up in answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am getting the bed ready now,\" she called down again, as she"
1448 "went busily to and fro at her work, \"but I shall want you to"
1448 "bring me up a sheet; you can't have a bed without a sheet, you"
1448 "want it to lie upon.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"All right,\" said the grandfather, and presently he went to the"
1448 "cupboard, and after rummaging about inside for a few minutes he"
1448 "drew out a long, coarse piece of stuff, which was all he had to"
1448 "do duty for a sheet. He carried it up to the loft, where he"
1448 "found Heidi had already made quite a nice bed. She had put an"
1448 "extra heap of hay at one end for a pillow, and had so arranged it"
1448 "that, when in bed, she would be able to see comfortably out"
1448 "through the round window."
1448 ""
1448 "\"That is capital,\" said her grandfather; \"now we must put on the"
1448 "sheet, but wait a moment first,\" and he went and fetched another"
1448 "large bundle of hay to make the bed thicker, so that the child"
1448 "should not feel the hard floor under her--\"there, now bring it"
1448 "here.\" Heidi had got hold of the sheet, but it was almost too"
1448 "heavy for her to carry; this was a good thing, however, as the"
1448 "close thick stuff would prevent the sharp stalks of the hay"
1448 "running through and pricking her. The two together now spread"
1448 "the sheet over the bed, and where it was too long or too broad,"
1448 "Heidi quickly tucked it in under the hay. It looked now as tidy"
1448 "and comfortable a bed as you could wish for, and Heidi stood"
1448 "gazing thoughtfully at her handiwork."
1448 ""
1448 "\"We have forgotten something now, grandfather,\" she said after a"
1448 "short silence."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What's that?\" he asked."
1448 ""
1448 "\"A coverlid; when you get into bed, you have to creep in between"
1448 "the sheets and the coverlid.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, that's the way, is it? But suppose I have not got a"
1448 "coverlid?\" said the old man."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, never mind, grandfather,\" said Heidi in a consoling tone"
1448 "of voice, \"I can take some more hay to put over me,\" and she was"
1448 "turning quickly to fetch another armful from the heap, when her"
1448 "grandfather stopped her. \"Wait a moment,\" he said, and he"
1448 "climbed down the ladder again and went towards his bed. He"
1448 "returned to the loft with a large, thick sack, made of flax,"
1448 "which he threw down, exclaiming, \"There, that is better than hay,"
1448 "is it not?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi began tugging away at the sack with all her little might,"
1448 "in her efforts to get it smooth and straight, but her small"
1448 "hands were not fitted for so heavy a job. Her grandfather came to"
1448 "her assistance, and when they had got it tidily spread over the"
1448 "bed, it all looked so nice and warm and comfortable that Heidi"
1448 "stood gazing at it in delight. \"That is a splendid coverlid,\" she"
1448 "said, \"and the bed looks lovely altogether! I wish it was night,"
1448 "so that I might get inside it at once.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I think we might have something to eat first,\" said the"
1448 "grandfather, \"what do you think?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi in the excitement of bed-making had forgotten everything"
1448 "else; but now when she began to think about food she felt"
1448 "terribly hungry, for she had had nothing to eat since the piece"
1448 "of bread and little cup of thin coffee that had been her"
1448 "breakfast early that morning before starting on her long, hot"
1448 "journey. So she answered without hesitation, \"Yes, I think so"
1448 "too.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Let us go down then, as we both think alike,\" said the old man,"
1448 "and he followed the child down the ladder. Then he went up to"
1448 "the hearth, pushed the big kettle aside, and drew forward the"
1448 "little one that was hanging on the chain, and seating himself on"
1448 "the round-topped, three-legged stool before the fire, blew it up"
1448 "into a clear bright flame. The kettle soon began to boil, and"
1448 "meanwhile the old man held a large piece of cheese on a long"
1448 "iron fork over the fire, turning it round and round till it was"
1448 "toasted a nice golden yellow color on each side. Heidi watched"
1448 "all that was going on with eager curiosity. Suddenly some new"
1448 "idea seemed to come into her head, for she turned and ran to the"
1448 "cupboard, and then began going busily backwards and forwards."
1448 "Presently the grandfather got up and came to the table with a"
1448 "jug and the cheese, and there he saw it already tidily laid with"
1448 "the round loaf and two plates and two knives each in its right"
1448 "place; for Heidi had taken exact note that morning of all that"
1448 "there was in the cupboard, and she knew which things would be"
1448 "wanted for their meal."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, that's right,\" said the grandfather, \"I am glad to see that"
1448 "you have some ideas of your own,\" and as he spoke he laid the"
1448 "toasted cheese on a layer of bread, \"but there is still"
1448 "something missing.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi looked at the jug that was steaming away invitingly, and"
1448 "ran quickly back to the cupboard. At first she could only see a"
1448 "small bowl left on the shelf, but she was not long in"
1448 "perplexity, for a moment later she caught sight of two glasses"
1448 "further back, and without an instant's loss of time she returned"
1448 "with these and the bowl and put them down on the table."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Good, I see you know how to set about things; but what will you"
1448 "do for a seat?\" The grandfather himself was sitting on the only"
1448 "chair in the room. Heidi flew to the hearth, and dragging the"
1448 "three-legged stool up to the table, sat herself down upon it."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, you have managed to find a seat for yourself, I see, only"
1448 "rather a low one I am afraid,\" said the grandfather, \"but you"
1448 "would not be tall enough to reach the table even if you sat in"
1448 "my chair; the first thing now, however, is to have something to"
1448 "eat, so come along.\""
1448 ""
1448 "With that he stood up, filled the bowl with milk, and placing it"
1448 "on the chair, pushed it in front of Heidi on her little three-"
1448 "legged stool, so that she now had a table to herself. Then he"
1448 "brought her a large slice of bread and a piece of the golden"
1448 "cheese, and told her to eat. After which he went and sat down on"
1448 "the corner of the table and began his own meal. Heidi lifted the"
1448 "bowl with both hands and drank without pause till it was empty,"
1448 "for the thirst of all her long hot journey had returned upon"
1448 "her. Then she drew a deep breath--in the eagerness of her thirst"
1448 "she had not stopped to breathe--and put down the bowl."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Was the milk nice?\" asked her grandfather."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I never drank any so good before,\" answered Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Then you must have some more,\" and the old man filled her bowl"
1448 "again to the brim and set it before the child, who was now"
1448 "hungrily beginning her bread having first spread it with the"
1448 "cheese, which after being toasted was soft as butter; the two"
1448 "together tasted deliciously, and the child looked the picture of"
1448 "content as she sat eating, and at intervals taking further"
1448 "draughts of milk. The meal being over, the grandfather went"
1448 "outside to put the goat-shed in order, and Heidi watched with"
1448 "interest while he first swept it out, and then put fresh straw"
1448 "for the goats to sleep upon. Then he went to the little well-"
1448 "shed, and there he cut some long round sticks, and a small round"
1448 "board; in this he bored some holes and stuck the sticks into"
1448 "them, and there, as if made by magic, was a three-legged stool"
1448 "just like her grandfather's, only higher. Heidi stood and looked"
1448 "at it, speechless with astonishment."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What do you think that is?\" asked her grandfather."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It's my stool, I know, because it is such a high one; and it"

1448 "and admiration."

1448 "\"She understands what she sees, her eyes are in the right"
1448 "place,\" remarked the grandfather to himself, as he continued his"
1448 "way round the hut, knocking in a nail here and there, or making"
1448 "fast some part of the door, and so with hammer and nails and"
1448 "pieces of wood going from spot to spot, mending or clearing away"
1448 "wherever work of the kind was needed. Heidi followed him step by"
1448 "step, her eyes attentively taking in all that he did, and"
1448 "everything that she saw was a fresh source of pleasure to her."
1448 ""
1448 "And so the time passed happily on till evening. Then the wind"
1448 "began to roar louder than ever through the old fir trees; Heidi"
1448 "listened with delight to the sound, and it filled her heart so"
1448 "full of gladness that she skipped and danced round the old"
1448 "trees, as if some unheard of joy had come to her. The grandfather"
1448 "stood and watched her from the shed."
1448 ""
1448 "Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Heidi paused in her"
1448 "dancing, and the grandfather came out. Down from the heights"
1448 "above the goats came springing one after another, with Peter in"
1448 "their midst. Heidi sprang forward with a cry of joy and rushed"
1448 "among the flock, greeting first one and then another of her old"
1448 "friends of the morning. As they neared the hut the goats stood"
1448 "still, and then two of their number, two beautiful slender"
1448 "animals, one white and one brown, ran forward to where the"
1448 "grandfather was standing and began licking his hands, for he was"
1448 "holding a little salt which he always had ready for his goats on"
1448 "their return home. Peter disappeared with the remainder of his"
1448 "flock. Heidi tenderly stroked the two goats in turn, running"
1448 "first to one side of them and then the other, and jumping about"
1448 "in her glee at the pretty little animals. \"Are they ours,"
1448 "grandfather? Are they both ours? Are you going to put them in the"
1448 "shed? Will they always stay with us?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi's questions came tumbling out one after the other, so that"
1448 "her grandfather had only time to answer each of them with \"Yes,"
1448 "yes.\" When the goats had finished licking up the salt her"
1448 "grandfather told her to go and fetch her bowl and the bread."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi obeyed and was soon back again. The grandfather milked the"
1448 "white goat and filled her basin, and then breaking off a piece"
1448 "of bread, \"Now eat your supper,\" he said, \"and then go up to bed."
1448 "Cousin Dete left another little bundle for you with a nightgown"
1448 "and other small things in it, which you will find at the bottom"
1448 "of the cupboard if you want them. I must go and shut up the"
1448 "goats, so be off and sleep well.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Good-night, grandfather! good-night. What are their names,"
1448 "grandfather, what are their names?\" she called out as she ran"
1448 "after his retreating figure and the goats."
1448 ""
1448 "\"The white one is named Little Swan, and the brown one Little"
1448 "Bear,\" he answered."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Good-night, Little Swan, good-night, Little Bear!\" she called"
1448 "again at the top of her voice, for they were already inside the"
1448 "shed. Then she sat down on the seat and began to eat and drink,"
1448 "but the wind was so strong that it almost blew her away; so she"
1448 "made haste and finished her supper and then went indoors and"
1448 "climbed up to her bed, where she was soon lying as sweetly and"
1448 "soundly asleep as any young princess on her couch of silk."
1448 ""
1448 "Not long after, and while it was still twilight, the grandfather"
1448 "also went to bed, for he was up every morning at sunrise, and"
1448 "the sun came climbing up over the mountains at a very early hour"
1448 "during these summer months. The wind grew so tempestuous during"
1448 "the night, and blew in such gusts against the walls, that the"
1448 "hut trembled and the old beams groaned and creaked. It came"
1448 "howling and wailing down the chimney like voices of those in"
1448 "pain, and it raged with such fury among the old fir trees that"
1448 "here and there a branch was snapped and fell. In the middle of"
1448 "the night the old man got up. \"The child will be frightened,\" he"
1448 "murmured half aloud. He mounted the ladder and went and stood by"
1448 "the child's bed."

1448 "Outside the moon was struggling with the dark, fast-driving"
1448 "clouds, which at one moment left it clear and shining, and the"
1448 "next swept over it, and all again was dark. Just now the"
1448 "moonlight was falling through the round window straight on to"
1448 "Heidi's bed. She lay under the heavy coverlid, her cheeks rosy"
1448 "with sleep, her head peacefully resting on her little round arm,"
1448 "and with a happy expression on her baby face as if dreaming of"
1448 "something pleasant. The old man stood looking down on the"
1448 "sleeping child until the moon again disappeared behind the"
1448 "clouds and he could see no more, then he went back to bed."

1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was awakened early the next morning by a loud whistle; the"
1448 "sun was shining through the round window and falling in golden"
1448 "rays on her bed and on the large heap of hay, and as she opened"
1448 "her eyes everything in the loft seemed gleaming with gold. She"
1448 "looked around her in astonishment and could not imagine for a"
1448 "while where she was. But her grandfather's deep voice was now"
1448 "heard outside, and then Heidi began to recall all that had"
1448 "happened: how she had come away from her former home and was now"
1448 "on the mountain with her grandfather instead of with old Ursula."
1448 "The latter was nearly stone deaf and always felt cold, so that"
1448 "she sat all day either by the hearth in the kitchen or by the"
1448 "sitting-room stove, and Heidi had been obliged to stay close to"
1448 "her, for the old woman was so deaf that she could not tell where"
1448 "the child was if out of her sight. And Heidi, shut up within the"
1448 "four walls, had often longed to be out of doors. So she felt"
1448 "very happy this morning as she woke up in her new home and"
1448 "remembered all the many new things that she had seen the day"
1448 "before and which she would see again that day, and above all she"
1448 "thought with delight of the two dear goats. Heidi jumped quickly"
1448 "out of bed and a very few minutes sufficed her to put on the"
1448 "clothes which she had taken off the night before, for there were"
1448 "not many of them. Then she climbed down the ladder and ran"
1448 "outside the hut. There stood Peter already with his flock of"
1448 "goats, and the grandfather was just bringing his two out of the"
1448 "shed to join the others. Heidi ran forward to wish good-morning"
1448 "to him and the goats."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you want to go with them on to the mountain?\" asked her"
1448 "grandfather. Nothing could have pleased Heidi better, and she"
1448 "jumped for joy in answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But you must first wash and make yourself tidy. The sun that"
1448 "shines so brightly overhead will else laugh at you for being"
1448 "dirty; see, I have put everything ready for you,\" and her"
1448 "grandfather pointed as he spoke to a large tub full of water,"
1448 "which stood in the sun before the door. Heidi ran to it and"
1448 "began splashing and rubbing, till she quite glistened with"
1448 "cleanliness. The grandfather meanwhile went inside the hut,"
1448 "calling to Peter to follow him and bring in his wallet. Peter"
1448 "obeyed with astonishment, and laid down the little bag which held"
1448 "his meagre dinner."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Open it,\" said the old man, and inside it he put a large piece"
1448 "of bread and an equally large piece of cheese, which made Peter"
1448 "open his eyes, for each was twice the size of the two portions"
1448 "which he had for his own dinner."
1448 ""
1448 "\"There, now there is only the little bowl to add,\" continued the"
1448 "grandfather, \"for the child cannot drink her milk as you do from"
1448 "the goat; she is not accustomed to that. You must milk two"
1448 "bowlfuls for her when she has her dinner, for she is going with"
1448 "you and will remain with you till you return this evening; but"
1448 "take care she does not fall over any of the rocks, do you hear?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi now came running in. \"Will the sun laugh at me now,"
1448 "grandfather?\" she asked anxiously. Her grandfather had left a"
1448 "coarse towel hanging up for her near the tub, and with this she"
1448 "had so thoroughly scrubbed her face, arms, and neck, for fear of"
1448 "the sun, that as she stood there she was as red all over as a"
1448 "lobster. He gave a little laugh."
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, there is nothing for him to laugh at now,\" he assured her."
1448 "\"But I tell you what--when you come home this evening, you will"
1448 "have to get right into the tub, like a fish, for if you run"
1448 "about like the goats you will get your feet dirty. Now you can be"
1448 "off.\""
1448 ""
1448 "She started joyfully for the mountain. During the night the wind"
1448 "had blown away all the clouds; the dark blue sky was spreading"
1448 "overhead, and in its midst was the bright sun shining down on"
1448 "the green slopes of the mountain, where the flowers opened their"
1448 "little blue and yellow cups, and looked up to him smiling. Heidi"
1448 "went running hither and thither and shouting with delight, for"
1448 "here were whole patches of delicate red primroses, and there the"
1448 "blue gleam of the lovely gentian, while above them all laughed"
1448 "and nodded the tender-leaved golden cistus. Enchanted with all"
1448 "this waving field of brightly-colored flowers, Heidi forgot even"
1448 "Peter and the goats. She ran on in front and then off to the"
1448 "side, tempted first one way and then the other, as she caught"
1448 "sight of some bright spot of glowing red or yellow. And all the"
1448 "while she was plucking whole handfuls of the flowers which she"
1448 "put into her little apron, for she wanted to take them all home"
1448 "and stick them in the hay, so that she might make her bedroom"
1448 "look just like the meadows outside. Peter had therefore to be on"
1448 "the alert, and his round eyes, which did not move very quickly,"
1448 "had more work than they could well manage, for the goats were as"
1448 "lively as Heidi; they ran in all directions, and Peter had to"
1448 "follow whistling and calling and swinging his stick to get all"
1448 "the runaways together again."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Where have you got to now, Heidi?\" he called out somewhat"
1448 "crossly."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Here,\" called back a voice from somewhere. Peter could see no"
1448 "one, for Heidi was seated on the ground at the foot of a small"
1448 "hill thickly overgrown with sweet smelling prunella; the whole"
1448 "air seemed filled with its fragrance, and Heidi thought she had"
1448 "never smelt anything so delicious. She sat surrounded by the"
1448 "flowers, drawing in deep breaths of the scented air."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Come along here!\" called Peter again. \"You are not to fall over"
1448 "the rocks, your grandfather gave orders that you were not to do"
1448 "so.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Where are the rocks?\" asked Heidi, answering him back. But she"
1448 "did not move from her seat, for the scent of the flowers seemed"
1448 "sweeter to her with every breath of wind that wafted it towards"
1448 "her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Up above, right up above. We have a long way to go yet, so come"
1448 "along! And on the topmost peak of all the old bird of prey sits"
1448 "and croaks.\""
1448 ""
1448 "That did it. Heidi immediately sprang to her feet and ran up to"
1448 "Peter with her apron full of flowers."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You have got enough now,\" said the boy as they began climbing"
1448 "up again together. \"You will stay here forever if you go on"
1448 "picking, and if you gather all the flowers now there will be none"
1448 "for to-morrow.\""
1448 ""
1448 "This last argument seemed a convincing one to Heidi, and"
1448 "moreover her apron was already so full that there was hardly room"
1448 "for another flower, and it would never do to leave nothing to"
1448 "pick for another day. So she now kept with Peter, and the goats"
1448 "also became more orderly in their behavior, for they were"
1448 "beginning to smell the plants they loved that grew on the higher"
1448 "slopes and clambered up now without pause in their anxiety to"
1448 "reach them. The spot where Peter generally halted for his goats"
1448 "to pasture and where he took up his quarters for the day lay at"
1448 "the foot of the high rocks, which were covered for some distance"
1448 "up by bushes and fir trees, beyond which rose their bare and"
1448 "rugged summits. On one side of the mountain the rock was split"
1448 "into deep clefts, and the grandfather had reason to warn Peter of"
1448 "danger. Having climbed as far as the halting-place, Peter unslung"
1448 "his wallet and put it carefully in a little hollow of the ground,"
1448 "for he knew what the wind was like up there and did not want to"
1448 "see his precious belongings sent rolling down the mountain by a"
1448 "sudden gust. Then be threw himself at full length on the warm"
1448 "ground, for he was tired after all his exertions."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi meanwhile had unfastened her apron and rolling it"
1448 "carefully round the flowers laid it beside Peter's wallet inside"
1448 "the hollow; she then sat down beside his outstretched figure and"
1448 "looked about her. The valley lay far below bathed in the morning"
1448 "sun. In front of her rose a broad snow-field, high against the"
1448 "dark-blue sky, while to the left was a huge pile of rocks on"
1448 "either side of which a bare lofty peak, that seemed to pierce"
1448 "the blue, looked frowningly down upon, her. The child sat without"
1448 "moving, her eyes taking in the whole scene, and all around was a"
1448 "great stillness, only broken by soft, light puffs of wind that"
1448 "swayed the light bells of the blue flowers, and the shining gold"
1448 "heads of the cistus, and set them nodding merrily on their"
1448 "slender stems. Peter had fallen asleep after his fatigue and the"
1448 "goats were climbing about among the bushes overhead. Heidi had"
1448 "never felt so happy in her life before. She drank in the golden"
1448 "sunlight, the fresh air, the sweet smell of the flowers, and"
1448 "wished for nothing better than to remain there forever. So the"
1448 "time went on, while to Heidi, who had so often looked up from"
1448 "the valley at the mountains above, these seemed now to have"
1448 "faces, and to be looking down at her like old friends. Suddenly"
1448 "she heard a loud harsh cry overhead and lifting her eyes she saw"
1448 "a bird, larger than any she had ever seen before, with great,"
1448 "spreading wings, wheeling round and round in wide circles, and"
1448 "uttering a piercing, croaking kind of sound above her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Peter, Peter, wake up!\" called out Heidi. \"See, the great bird"
1448 "is there--look, look!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter got up on hearing her call, and together they sat and"
1448 "watched the bird, which rose higher and higher in the blue air"
1448 "till it disappeared behind the grey mountain-tops."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Where has it gone to?\" asked Heidi, who had followed the bird's"
1448 "movements with intense interest."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Home to its nest,\" said Peter."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Is his home right up there? Oh, how nice to be up so high! why"
1448 "does he make that noise?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Because he can't help it,\" explained Peter."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Let us climb up there and see where his nest is,\" proposed"
1448 "Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh! oh! oh!\" exclaimed Peter, his disapproval of Heidi's"
1448 "suggestion becoming more marked with each ejaculation, \"why even"
1448 "the goats cannot climb as high as that, besides didn't Uncle say"
1448 "that you were not to fall over the rocks?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter now began suddenly whistling and calling in such a loud"
1448 "manner that Heidi could not think what was happening; but the"
1448 "goats evidently understood his voice, for one after the other"
1448 "they came springing down the rocks until they were all assembled"
1448 "on the green plateau, some continuing to nibble at the juicy"
1448 "stems, others skipping about here and there or pushing at each"
1448 "other with their horns for pastime."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi jumped up and ran in and out among them, for it was new to"
1448 "her to see the goats playing together like this and her delight"
1448 "was beyond words as she joined in their frolics; she made"
1448 "personal acquaintance with them all in turn, for they were like"
1448 "separate individuals to her, each single goat having a"
1448 "particular way of behavior of its own. Meanwhile Peter had taken"
1448 "the wallet out of the hollow and placed the pieces of bread and"
1448 "cheese on the ground in the shape of a square, the larger two on"
1448 "Heidi's side and the smaller on his own, for he knew exactly"
1448 "which were hers and which his. Then he took the little bowl and"
1448 "milked some delicious fresh milk into it from the white goat, and"
1448 "afterwards set the bowl in the middle of the square. Now he"
1448 "called Heidi to come, but she wanted more calling than the goats,"
1448 "for the child was so excited and amused at the capers and lively"
1448 "games of her new playfellows that she saw and heard nothing else."
1448 "But Peter knew how to make himself heard, for he shouted till the"
1448 "very rocks above echoed his voice, and at last Heidi appeared,"
1448 "and when she saw the inviting repast spread out upon the ground"
1448 "she went skipping round it for joy."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Leave off jumping about, it is time for dinner,\" said Peter;"
1448 "\"sit down now and begin.\""

1448 "Heidi sat down. \"Is the milk for me?\" she asked, giving another"
1448 "look of delight at the beautifully arranged square with the bowl"
1448 "as a chief ornament in the centre."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes,\" replied Peter, \"and the two large pieces of bread and"
1448 "cheese are yours also, and when you have drunk up that milk, you"
1448 "are to have another bowlful from the white goat, and then it"
1448 "will be my turn.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"And which do you get your milk from?\" inquired Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"From my own goat, the piebald one. But go on now with your"
1448 "dinner,\" said Peter, again reminding her it was time to eat."
1448 "Heidi now took up the bowl and drank her milk, and as soon as"
1448 "she had put it down empty Peter rose and filled it again for her."
1448 "Then she broke off a piece of her bread and held out the"
1448 "remainder, which was still larger than Peter's own piece,"
1448 "together with the whole big slice of cheese to her companion,"
1448 "saying, \"You can have that, I have plenty.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter looked at Heidi, unable to speak for astonishment, for"
1448 "never in all his life could he have said and done like that with"
1448 "anything he had. He hesitated a moment, for he could not believe"
1448 "that Heidi was in earnest; but the latter kept on holding out"
1448 "the bread and cheese, and as Peter still did not take it, she"
1448 "laid it down on his knees. He saw then that she really meant it;"
1448 "he seized the food, nodded his thanks and acceptance of her"
1448 "present, and then made a more splendid meal than he had known"
1448 "ever since he was a goat-herd. Heidi the while still continued to"
1448 "watch the goats. \"Tell me all their names,\" she said."
1448 ""
1448 "Peter knew these by heart, for having very little else to carry"
1448 "in his head he had no difficulty in remembering them. So he"
1448 "began, telling Heidi the name of each goat in turn as he pointed"
1448 "it out to her. Heidi listened with great attention, and it was"
1448 "not long before she could herself distinguish the goats from one"
1448 "another and could call each by name, for every goat had its own"
1448 "peculiarities which could not easily be mistaken; only one had"
1448 "to watch them closely, and this Heidi did. There was the great"
1448 "Turk with his big horns, who was always wanting to butt the"
1448 "others, so that most of them ran away when they saw him coming"
1448 "and would have nothing to do with their rough companion. Only"
1448 "Greenfinch, the slender nimble little goat, was brave enough to"
1448 "face him, and would make a rush at him, three or four times in"
1448 "succession, with such agility and dexterity, that the great Turk"
1448 "often stood still quite astounded not venturing to attack her"
1448 "again, for Greenfinch was fronting him, prepared for more warlike"
1448 "action, and her horns were sharp. Then there was little White"
1448 "Snowflake, who bleated in such a plaintive and beseeching manner"
1448 "that Heidi already had several times run to it and taken its head"
1448 "in her hands to comfort it. Just at this moment the pleading"
1448 "young cry was heard again, and Heidi jumped up running and,"
1448 "putting her arms round the little creature's neck, asked in a"
1448 "sympathetic voice, \"What is it, little Snowflake? Why do you call"
1448 "like that as if in trouble?\" The goat pressed closer to Heidi in"
1448 "a confiding way and left off bleating. Peter called out from"
1448 "where he was sitting--for he had not yet got to the end of his"
1448 "bread and cheese, \"She cries like that because the old goat is"
1448 "not with her; she was sold at Mayenfeld the day before yesterday,"
1448 "and so will not come up the mountain any more.\""

1448 "\"Who is the old goat?\" called Heidi back."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why, her mother, of course,\" was the answer."

1448 "animal gently to her, \"but do not cry like that any more; see"
1448 "now, I shall come up here with you every day, so that you will"
1448 "not be alone any more, and if you want anything you have only to"
1448 "come to me.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The young animal rubbed its head contentedly against Heidi's"
1448 "shoulder, and no longer gave such plaintive bleats. Peter now"
1448 "having finished his meal joined Heidi and the goats, Heidi"
1448 "having by this time found out a great many things about these."
1448 "She had decided that by far the handsomest and best-behaved of"
1448 "the goats were undoubtedly the two belonging to her grandfather;"
1448 "they carried themselves with a certain air of distinction and"
1448 "generally went their own way, and as to the great Turk they"
1448 "treated him with indifference and contempt."

1448 "The goats were now beginning to climb the rocks again, each"
1448 "seeking for the plants it liked in its own fashion, some jumping"
1448 "over everything they met till they found what they wanted,"
1448 "others going more carefully and cropping all the nice leaves by"
1448 "the way, the Turk still now and then giving the others a poke"
1448 "with his horns. Little Swan and Little Bear clambered lightly up"
1448 "and never failed to find the best bushes, and then they would"
1448 "stand gracefully poised on their pretty legs, delicately nibbling"
1448 "at the leaves. Heidi stood with her hands behind her back,"
1448 "carefully noting all they did."

1448 "\"Yes, I know they are,\" was the answer. \"Alm-Uncle brushes them"
1448 "down and washes them and gives them salt, and he has the nicest"
1448 "shed for them.\""
1448 ""
1448 "All of a sudden Peter leaped to his feet and ran hastily after"
1448 "the goats. Heidi followed him as fast as she could, for she was"
1448 "too eager to know what had happened to stay behind. Peter dashed"
1448 "through the middle of the flock towards that side of the"
1448 "mountain where the rocks fell perpendicularly to a great depth"
1448 "below, and where any thoughtless goat, if it went too near, might"
1448 "fall over and break all its legs. He had caught sight of the"
1448 "inquisitive Greenfinch taking leaps in that direction, and he was"
1448 "only just in time, for the animal had already sprung to the edge"
1448 "of the abyss. All Peter could do was to throw himself down and"
1448 "seize one of her hind legs. Greenfinch, thus taken by surprise,"
1448 "began bleating furiously, angry at being held so fast and"
1448 "prevented from continuing her voyage of discovery. She struggled"
1448 "to get loose, and endeavored so obstinately to leap forward that"
1448 "Peter shouted to Heidi to come and help him, for he could not get"
1448 "up and was afraid of pulling out the goat's leg altogether."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi had already run up and she saw at once the danger both"
1448 "Peter and the animal were in. She quickly gathered a bunch of"
1448 "sweet-smelling leaves, and then, holding them under Greenfinch's"
1448 "nose, said coaxingly, \"Come, come, Greenfinch, you must not be"
1448 "naughty! Look, you might fall down there and break your leg, and"
1448 "that would give you dreadful pain!\""
1448 ""
1448 "The young animal turned quickly, and began contentedly eating"
1448 "the leaves out of Heidi's hand. Meanwhile Peter got on to his"
1448 "feet again and took hold of Greenfinch by the band round her neck"
1448 "from which her bell was hung, and Heidi taking hold of her in the"
1448 "same way on the other side, they led the wanderer back to the"
1448 "rest of the flock that had remained peacefully feeding. Peter,"
1448 "now he had his goat in safety, lifted his stick in order to give"
1448 "her a good beating as punishment, and Greenfinch seeing what was"
1448 "coming shrank back in fear. But Heidi cried out, \"No, no, Peter,"
1448 "you must not strike her; see how frightened she is!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"She deserves it,\" growled Peter, and again lifted his stick."
1448 "Then Heidi flung herself against him and cried indignantly, \"You"
1448 "have no right to touch her, it will hurt her, let her alone!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter looked with surprise at the commanding little figure,"
1448 "whose dark eyes were flashing, and reluctantly he let his stick"
1448 "drop. \"Well I will let her off if you will give me some more of"
1448 "your cheese to-morrow,\" he said, for he was determined to have"
1448 "something to make up to him for his fright."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You shall have it all, to-morrow and every day, I do not want"
1448 "it,\" replied Heidi, giving ready consent to his demand. \"And I"
1448 "will give you bread as well, a large piece like you had to-day;"
1448 "but then you must promise never to beat Greenfinch, or"
1448 "Snowflake, or any of the goats.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"All right,\" said Peter, \"I don't care,\" which meant that he"
1448 "would agree to the bargain. He now let go of Greenfinch, who"
1448 "joyfully sprang to join her companions."
1448 ""
1448 "And thus imperceptibly the day had crept on to its close, and"
1448 "now the sun was on the point of sinking out of sight behind the"
1448 "high mountains. Heidi was again sitting on the ground, silently"
1448 "gazing at the blue bell-shaped flowers, as they glistened in the"
1448 "evening sun, for a golden light lay on the grass and flowers, and"
1448 "the rocks above were beginning to shine and glow. All at once she"
1448 "sprang to her feet, \"Peter! Peter! everything is on fire! All"
1448 "the rocks are burning, and the great snow mountain and the sky! O"
1448 "look, look! the high rock up there is red with flame! O the"
1448 "beautiful, fiery snow! Stand up, Peter! See, the fire has"
1448 "reached the great bird's nest! look at the rocks! look at the fir"
1448 "trees! Everything, everything is on fire!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"It is always like that,\" said Peter composedly, continuing to"
1448 "peel his stick; \"but it is not really fire.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"What is it then?\" cried Heidi, as she ran backwards and"
1448 "forwards to look first one side and then the other, for she felt"
1448 "she could not have enough of such a beautiful sight. \"What is it,"
1448 "Peter, what is it?\" she repeated."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It gets like that of itself,\" explained Peter."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Look, look!\" cried Heidi in fresh excitement, \"now they have"
1448 "turned all rose color! Look at that one covered with snow, and"
1448 "that with the high, pointed rocks! What do you call them?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Mountains have not any names,\" he answered."
1448 ""
1448 "\"O how beautiful, look at the crimson snow! And up there on the"
1448 "rocks there are ever so many roses! Oh! now they are turning"
1448 "grey! Oh! oh! now all the color has died away! it's all gone,"
1448 "Peter.\" And Heidi sat down on the ground looking as full of"
1448 "distress as if everything had really come to an end."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It will come again to-morrow,\" said Peter. \"Get up, we must go"
1448 "home now.\" He whistled to his goats and together they all"
1448 "started on their homeward way."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Is it like that every day, shall we see it every day when we"
1448 "bring the goats up here?\" asked Heidi, as she clambered down the"
1448 "mountain at Peter's side; she waited eagerly for his answer,"
1448 "hoping that he would tell her it was so."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It is like that most days,\" he replied."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But will it be like that to-morrow for certain?\" Heidi"
1448 "persisted."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, yes, to-morrow for certain,\" Peter assured her in answer."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi now felt quite happy again, and her little brain was so"
1448 "full of new impressions and new thoughts that she did not speak"
1448 "any more until they had reached the hut. The grandfather was"
1448 "sitting under the fir trees, where he had also put up a seat,"
1448 "waiting as usual for his goats which returned down the mountain"
1448 "on this side."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi ran up to him followed by the white and brown goats, for"
1448 "they knew their own master and stall. Peter called out after"
1448 "her, \"Come with me again to-morrow! Good-night!\" For he was"
1448 "anxious for more than one reason that Heidi should go with him"
1448 "the next day."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi ran back quickly and gave Peter her hand, promising to go"
1448 "with him, and then making her way through the goats she once"
1448 "more clasped Snowflake round the neck, saying in a gentle"
1448 "soothing voice, \"Sleep well, Snowflake, and remember that I shall"
1448 "be with you again to-morrow, so you must not bleat so sadly any"
1448 "more.\" Snowflake gave her a friendly and grateful look, and then"
1448 "went leaping joyfully after the other goats."

1448 "Heidi returned to the fir-trees. \"O grandfather,\" she cried,"
1448 "even before she had come up to him, \"it was so beautiful. The"
1448 "fire, and the roses on the rocks, and the blue and yellow"
1448 "flowers, and look what I have brought you!\" And opening the apron"
1448 "that held her flowers she shook them all out at her grandfather's"
1448 "feet. But the poor flowers, how changed they were! Heidi hardly"
1448 "knew them again. They looked like dry bits of hay, not a single"
1448 "little flower cup stood open. \"O grandfather, what is the matter"
1448 "with them?\" exclaimed Heidi in shocked surprise, \"they were not"
1448 "like that this morning, why do they look so now?\""

1448 "\"They like to stand out there in the sun and not to be shut up"

1448 "\"Then I will never gather any more. But, grandfather, why did"
1448 "the great bird go on croaking so?\" she continued in an eager tone"
1448 "of inquiry."

1448 "\"Go along now and get into your bath while I go and get some"
1448 "milk; when we are together at supper I will tell you all about"
1448 "it.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi obeyed, and when later she was sitting on her high stool"
1448 "before her milk bowl with her grandfather beside her, she"
1448 "repeated her question, \"Why does the great bird go on croaking"
1448 "and screaming down at us, grandfather?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"He is mocking at the people who live down below in the"
1448 "villages, because they all go huddling and gossiping together,"
1448 "and encourage one another in evil talking and deeds. He calls"
1448 "out, 'If you would separate and each go your own way and come up"
1448 "here and live on a height as I do, it would be better for you!'\""
1448 "There was almost a wildness in the old man's voice as he spoke,"
1448 "so that Heidi seemed to hear the croaking of the bird again even"
1448 "more distinctly."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why haven't the mountains any names?\" Heidi went on."
1448 ""
1448 "\"They have names,\" answered her grandfather, \"and if you can"
1448 "describe one of them to me that I know I will tell you what it"
1448 "is called.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi then described to him the rocky mountain with the two high"
1448 "peaks so exactly that the grandfather was delighted. \"Just so, I"
1448 "know it,\" and he told her its name. \"Did you see any other?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then Heidi told him of the mountain with the great snow-field,"
1448 "and how it had been on fire, and had turned rosy-red and then all"
1448 "of a sudden had grown quite pale again and all the color had"
1448 "disappeared."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I know that one too,\" he said, giving her its name. \"So you"
1448 "enjoyed being out with the goats?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then Heidi went on to give him an account of the whole day, and"
1448 "of how delightful it had all been, and particularly described"
1448 "the fire that had burst out everywhere in the evening. And then"
1448 "nothing would do but her grandfather must tell how it came, for"
1448 "Peter knew nothing about it."
1448 ""
1448 "The grandfather explained to her that it was the sun that did"
1448 "it. \"When he says good-night to the mountains he throws his most"
1448 "beautiful colors over them, so that they may not forget him"
1448 "before he comes again the next day.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was delighted with this explanation, and could hardly bear"
1448 "to wait for another day to come that she might once more climb"
1448 "up with the goats and see how the sun bid good-night to the"
1448 "mountains. But she had to go to bed first, and all night she"
1448 "slept soundly on her bed of hay, dreaming of nothing but of"
1448 "shining mountains with red roses all over them, among which"
1448 "happy little Snowflake went leaping in and out."

1448 ""
1448 "The next morning the sun came out early as bright as ever, and"
1448 "then Peter appeared with the goats, and again the two children"
1448 "climbed up together to the high meadows, and so it went on day"
1448 "after day till Heidi, passing her life thus among the grass and"
1448 "flowers, was burnt brown with the sun, and grew so strong and"
1448 "healthy that nothing ever ailed her. She was happy too, and"
1448 "lived from day to day as free and lighthearted as the little"
1448 "birds that make their home among the green forest trees. Then the"
1448 "autumn came, and the wind blew louder and stronger, and the"
1448 "grandfather would say sometimes, \"To-day you must stay at home,"
1448 "Heidi; a sudden gust of the wind would blow a little thing like"
1448 "you over the rocks into the valley below in a moment.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Whenever Peter heard that he must go alone he looked very"
1448 "unhappy, for he saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds ahead, and"
1448 "did not know how he should bear the long dull day without Heidi."
1448 "Then, too, there was the good meal he would miss, and besides"
1448 "that the goats on these days were so naughty and obstinate that"
1448 "he had twice the usual trouble with them, for they had grown so"
1448 "accustomed to Heidi's presence that they would run in every"
1448 "direction and refuse to go on unless she was with them. Heidi"
1448 "was never unhappy, for wherever she was she found something to"
1448 "interest or amuse her. She liked best, it is true, to go out"
1448 "with Peter up to the flowers and the great bird, where there was"
1448 "so much to be seen, and so many experiences to go through among"
1448 "the goats with their different characters; but she also found her"
1448 "grandfather's hammering and sawing and carpentering very"
1448 "entertaining, and if it should chance to be the day when the"
1448 "large round goat's-milk cheese was made she enjoyed beyond"
1448 "measure looking on at this wonderful performance, and watching"
1448 "her grandfather, as with sleeves rolled back, he stirred the"
1448 "great cauldron with his bare arms. The thing which attracted her"
1448 "most, however, was the waving and roaring of the three old fir"
1448 "trees on these windy days. She would run away repeatedly from"
1448 "whatever she might be doing, to listen to them, for nothing"
1448 "seemed so strange and wonderful to her as the deep mysterious"
1448 "sound in the tops of the trees. She would stand underneath them"
1448 "and look up, unable to tear herself away, looking and listening"
1448 "while they bowed and swayed and roared as the mighty wind rushed"
1448 "through them. There was no longer now the warm bright sun that"
1448 "had shone all through the summer, so Heidi went to the cupboard"
1448 "and got out her shoes and stockings and dress, for it was"
1448 "growing colder every day, and when Heidi stood under the fir"
1448 "trees the wind blew through her as if she was a thin little leaf,"
1448 "but still she felt she could not stay indoors when she heard the"
1448 "branches waving outside."
1448 ""
1448 "Then it grew very cold, and Peter would come up early in the"
1448 "morning blowing on his fingers to keep them warm. But he soon"
1448 "left off coming, for one night there was a heavy fall of snow"
1448 "and the next morning the whole mountain was covered with it, and"
1448 "not a single little green leaf was to be seen anywhere upon it."
1448 "There was no Peter that day, and Heidi stood at the little window"
1448 "looking out in wonderment, for the snow was beginning again, and"
1448 "the thick flakes kept falling till the snow was up to the"
1448 "window, and still they continued to fall, and the snow grew"
1448 "higher, so that at last the window could not be opened, and she"
1448 "and her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut. Heidi"
1448 "thought this was great fun and ran from one window to the other"
1448 "to see what would happen next, and whether the snow was going to"
1448 "cover up the whole hut, so that they would have to light a lamp"
1448 "although it was broad daylight. But things did not get as bad as"
1448 "that, and the next day, the snow having ceased, the grandfather"
1448 "went out and shovelled away the snow round the house, and threw"
1448 "it into such great heaps that they looked like mountains standing"
1448 "at intervals on either side the hut. And now the windows and door"
1448 "could be opened, and it was well it was so, for as Heidi and her"
1448 "grandfather were sitting one afternoon on their three-legged"
1448 "stools before the fire there came a great thump at the door"
1448 "followed by several others, and then the door opened. It was"
1448 "Peter, who had made all that noise knocking the snow off his"
1448 "shoes; he was still white all over with it, for he had had to"
1448 "fight his way through deep snowdrifts, and large lumps of snow"
1448 "that had frozen upon him still clung to his clothes. He had been"
1448 "determined, however, not to be beaten and to climb up to the"
1448 "hut, for it was a week now since he had seen Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Good-evening,\" he said as he came in; then he went and placed"
1448 "himself as near the fire as he could without saying another"
1448 "word, but his whole face was beaming with pleasure at finding"
1448 "himself there. Heidi looked on in astonishment, for Peter was"
1448 "beginning to thaw all over with the warmth, so that he had the"
1448 "appearance of a trickling waterfall."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, General, and how goes it with you?\" said the grandfather,"
1448 "\"now that you have lost your army you will have to turn to your"
1448 "pen and pencil.\""

1448 "\"Why must he turn to his pen and pencil?\" asked Heidi"
1448 "immediately, full of curiosity."
1448 ""
1448 "\"During the winter he must go to school,\" explained her"
1448 "grandfather, \"and learn how to read and write; it's a bit hard,"
1448 "although useful sometimes afterwards. Am I not right, General?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, indeed,\" assented Peter."

1448 "Heidi's interest was now thoroughly awakened, and she had so"
1448 "many questions to put to Peter about all that was to be done and"
1448 "seen and heard at school, and the conversation took so long that"
1448 "Peter had time to get thoroughly dry. Peter had always great"
1448 "difficulty in putting his thoughts into words, and he found his"
1448 "share of the talk doubly difficult to-day, for by the time he had"
1448 "an answer ready to one of Heidi's questions she had already put"
1448 "two or three more to him, and generally such as required a whole"
1448 "long sentence in reply."
1448 ""
1448 "The grandfather sat without speaking during this conversation,"
1448 "only now and then a twitch of amusement at the corners of his"

1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, now, General, you have been under fire for some time and"
1448 "must want some refreshment, come and join us,\" he said at last,"
1448 "and as he spoke he rose and went to fetch the supper out of the"
1448 "cupboard, and Heidi pushed the stools to the table. There was"
1448 "also now a bench fastened against the wall, for as he was no"
1448 "longer alone the grandfather had put up seats of various kinds"
1448 "here and there, long enough to hold two persons, for Heidi had a"
1448 "way of always keeping close to her grandfather whether he was"
1448 "walking, sitting or standing. So there was comfortable place for"
1448 "them all three, and Peter opened his round eyes very wide when"
1448 "he saw what a large piece of meat Alm-Uncle gave him on his thick"
1448 "slice of bread. It was a long time since Peter had had anything"
1448 "so nice to eat. As soon as the pleasant meal was over Peter"
1448 "began to get ready for returning home, for it was already growing"
1448 "dark. He had said his \"good-night\" and his thanks, and was just"
1448 "going out, when he turned again and said, \"I shall come again"
1448 "next Sunday, this day week, and grandmother sent word that she"
1448 "would like you to come and see her one day.\""

1448 "It was quite a new idea to Heidi that she should go and pay"
1448 "anybody a visit, and she could not get it out of her head; so"
1448 "the first thing she said to her grandfather the next day was, \"I"
1448 "must go down to see the grandmother to-day; she will be expecting"
1448 "me.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"The snow is too deep,\" answered the grandfather, trying to put"
1448 "her off. But Heidi had made up her mind to go, since the"
1448 "grandmother had sent her that message. She stuck to her"
1448 "intention and not a day passed but what in the course of it she"
1448 "said five or six times to her grandfather, \"I must certainly go"
1448 "to-day, the grandmother will be waiting for me.\""

1448 "On the fourth day, when with every step one took the ground"
1448 "crackled with frost and the whole vast field of snow was hard as"
1448 "ice, Heidi was sitting on her high stool at dinner with the"
1448 "bright sun shining in upon her through the window, and again"
1448 "repeated her little speech, \"I must certainly go down to see the"
1448 "grandmother to-day, or else I shall keep her waiting too long.\""

1448 "The grandfather rose from table, climbed up to the hay-loft and"
1448 "brought down the thick sack that was Heidi's coverlid, and said,"
1448 "\"Come along then!\" The child skipped out gleefully after him"
1448 "into the glittering world of snow."
1448 ""
1448 "The old fir trees were standing now quite silent, their branches"
1448 "covered with the white snow, and they looked so lovely as they"
1448 "glittered and sparkled in the sunlight that Heidi jumped for joy"
1448 "at the sight and kept on calling out, \"Come here, come here,"
1448 "grandfather! The fir trees are all silver and gold!\" The"
1448 "grandfather had gone into the shed and he now came out dragging"
1448 "a large hand-sleigh along with him; inside it was a low seat, and"
1448 "the sleigh could be pushed forward and guided by the feet of the"
1448 "one who sat upon it with the help of a pole that was fastened to"
1448 "the side. After he had been taken round the fir trees by Heidi"
1448 "that he might see their beauty from all sides, he got into the"
1448 "sleigh and lifted the child on to his lap; then he wrapped her"
1448 "up in the sack, that she might keep nice and warm, and put his"
1448 "left arm closely round her, for it was necessary to hold her"
1448 "tight during the coming journey. He now grasped the pole with his"
1448 "right hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet."
1448 "The sleigh shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that"
1448 "Heidi thought they were flying through the air like a bird, and"
1448 "shouted aloud with delight. Suddenly they came to a standstill,"
1448 "and there they were at Peter's hut. Her grandfather lifted her"
1448 "out and unwrapped her. \"There you are, now go in, and when it"
1448 "begins to grow dark you must start on your way home again.\" Then"
1448 "he left her and went up the mountain, pulling his sleigh after"
1448 "him."

1448 "Heidi opened the door of the hut and stepped into a tiny room"
1448 "that looked very dark, with a fireplace and a few dishes on a"
1448 "wooden shelf; this was the little kitchen. She opened another"
1448 "door, and now found herself in another small room, for the place"
1448 "was not a herdsman's hut like her grandfather's, with one large"
1448 "room on the ground floor and a hay-loft above, but a very old"
1448 "cottage, where everything was narrow and poor and shabby. A"
1448 "table was close to the door, and as Heidi stepped in she saw a"
1448 "woman sitting at it, putting a patch on a waistcoat which Heidi"
1448 "recognised at once as Peter's. In the corner sat an old woman,"
1448 "bent with age, spinning. Heidi was quite sure this was the"
1448 "grandmother, so she went up to the spinning-wheel and said, \"Good-"
1448 "day, grandmother, I have come at last; did you think I was a long"
1448 "time coming?\""

1448 "The woman raised her head and felt for the hand that the child"

1448 "child who lives up with Alm-Uncle, are you Heidi?\""

1448 "\"Yes, yes,\" answered Heidi, \"I have just come down in the sleigh"
1448 "with grandfather.\""

1448 "\"Is it possible! Why your hands are quite warm! Brigitta, did Alm-"
1448 "Uncle come himself with the child?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter's mother had left her work and risen from the table and"
1448 "now stood looking at Heidi with curiosity, scanning her from head"
1448 "to foot. \"I do not know, mother, whether Uncle came himself; it"
1448 "is hardly likely, the child probably makes a mistake.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But Heidi looked steadily at the woman, not at all as if in any"
1448 "uncertainty, and said, \"I know quite well who wrapped me in my"
1448 "bedcover and brought me down in the sleigh: it was grandfather.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"There was some truth then perhaps in what Peter used to tell us"
1448 "of Alm-Uncle during the summer, when we thought he must be"
1448 "wrong,\" said grandmother; \"but who would ever have believed that"
1448 "such a thing was possible? I did not think the child would live"
1448 "three weeks up there. What is she like, Brigitta?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The latter had so thoroughly examined Heidi on all sides that"
1448 "she was well able to describe her to her mother."
1448 ""
1448 "\"She has Adelaide's slenderness of figure, but her eyes are dark"
1448 "and her hair curly like her father's and the old man's up there:"
1448 "she takes after both of them, I think.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi meanwhile had not been idle; she had made the round of the"
1448 "room and looked carefully at everything there was to be seen."
1448 "All of a sudden she exclaimed, \"Grandmother, one of your shutters"
1448 "is flapping backwards and forwards; grandfather would put a nail"
1448 "in and make it all right in a minute, or else it will break one"
1448 "of the panes some day; look, look, how it keeps on banging!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, dear child,\" said the old woman, \"I am not able to see it,"
1448 "but I can hear that and many other things besides the shutter."
1448 "Everything about the place rattles and creaks when the wind is"
1448 "blowing, and it gets inside through all the cracks and holes."
1448 "The house is going to pieces, and in the night, when the two"
1448 "others are asleep, I often lie awake in fear and trembling,"
1448 "thinking that the whole place will give way and fall and kill us."
1448 "And there is not a creature to mend anything for us, for Peter"
1448 "does not understand such work.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"But why cannot you see, grandmother, that the shutter is loose."
1448 "Look, there it goes again, see, that one there!\" And Heidi"
1448 "pointed to the particular shutter."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Alas, child, it is not only that I cannot see--I can see,"
1448 "nothing, nothing,\" said the grandmother in a voice of"
1448 "lamentation."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But if I were to go outside and put back the shutter so that"
1448 "you had more light, then you could see, grandmother?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, no, not even then, no one can make it light for me again.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"But if you were to go outside among all the white snow, then"
1448 "surely you would find it light; just come with me, grandmother,"
1448 "and I will show you.\" Heidi took hold of the old woman's hand to"
1448 "lead her along, for she was beginning to feel quite distressed"
1448 "at the thought of her being without light."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Let me be, dear child; it is always dark for me now; whether in"
1448 "snow or sun, no light can penetrate my eyes.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"But surely it does in summer, grandmother,\" said Heidi, more"
1448 "and more anxious to find some way out of the trouble, \"when the"
1448 "hot sun is shining down again, and he says good-night to the"
1448 "mountains, and they all turn on fire, and the yellow flowers"
1448 "shine like gold, then, you will see, it will be bright and"
1448 "beautiful for you again.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, child, I shall see the mountains on fire or the yellow"
1448 "flowers no more; it will never be light for me again on earth,"
1448 "never.\""

1448 "no one do it? Isn't there any one who can do it?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The grandmother now tried to comfort the child, but it was not"
1448 "easy to quiet her. Heidi did not often weep, but when she did"
1448 "she could not get over her trouble for a long while. The"
1448 "grandmother had tried all means in her power to allay the child's"
1448 "grief, for it went to her heart to hear her sobbing so bitterly."
1448 "At last she said, \"Come here, dear Heidi, come and let me tell"
1448 "you something. You cannot think how glad one is to hear a kind"
1448 "word when one can no longer see, and it is such a pleasure to me"
1448 "to listen to you while you talk. So come and sit beside me and"
1448 "tell me something; tell me what you do up there, and how"
1448 "grandfather occupies himself. I knew him very well in old days;"
1448 "but for many years now I have heard nothing of him, except"
1448 "through Peter, who never says much.\""
1448 ""
1448 "This was a new and happy idea to Heidi; she quickly dried her"

1448 "not fall; he will put everything right for you.\""

1448 "The grandmother was silent, and Heidi now began to give her a"
1448 "lively description of her life with the grandfather, and of the"
1448 "days she spent on the mountain with the goats, and then went on"
1448 "to tell her of what she did now during the winter, and how her"
1448 "grandfather was able to make all sorts of things, seats and"
1448 "stools, and mangers where the hay was put for Little Swan and"
1448 "Little Bear, besides a new large water-tub for her to bathe in"
1448 "when the summer came, and a new milk-bowl and spoon, and Heidi"
1448 "grew more and more animated as she enumerated all the beautiful"
1448 "things which were made so magically out of pieces of wood; she"
1448 "then told the grandmother how she stood by him and watched all"
1448 "he did, and how she hoped some day to be able to make the same"
1448 "herself."

1448 "The grandmother listened with the greatest attention, only from"
1448 "time to time addressing her daughter, \"Do you hear that,"

1448 "The conversation was all at once interrupted by a heavy thump on"
1448 "the door, and in marched Peter, who stood stock-still, opening"
1448 "his eyes with astonishment, when he caught sight of Heidi; then"
1448 "his face beamed with smiles as she called out, \"Good-evening,"
1448 "Peter.\""

1448 "\"What, is the boy back from school already?\" exclaimed the"
1448 "grandmother in surprise. \"I have not known an afternoon pass so"
1448 "quickly as this one for years. How is the reading getting on,"
1448 "Peter?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Just the same,\" was Peter's answer."
1448 ""
1448 "The old woman gave a little sigh. \"Ah, well,\" she said, \"I hoped"

1448 "you are going to be twelve years old this February.\""
1448 ""

1448 ""
1448 "\"I must get a light, it is getting too dark to see,\" said"
1448 "Peter's mother, who was still busy mending his waistcoat. \"I feel"
1448 "too as if the afternoon had gone I hardly know how.\""

1448 "Heidi now jumped up from her low chair, and holding out her hand"

1448 "you must not go alone like that, Peter must go with you; and"
1448 "take care of the child, Peter, that she does not fall, and don't"
1448 "let her stand still for fear she should get frozen, do you hear?"
1448 "Has she got anything warm to put around her throat?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I have not anything to put on,\" called back Heidi, \"but I am"
1448 "sure I shall not be cold,\" and with that she ran outside and"
1448 "went off at such a pace that Peter had difficulty in overtaking"
1448 "her. The grandmother, still in distress, called out to her"
1448 "daughter, \"Run after her, Brigitta; the child will be frozen to"
1448 "death on such a night as this; take my shawl, run quickly!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Brigitta ran out. But the children had taken but a few steps"
1448 "before they saw the grandfather coming down to meet them, and in"
1448 "another minute his long strides had brought him to their side."
1448 ""
1448 "\"That's right, Heidi; you have kept your word,\" said the"
1448 "grandfather, and then wrapping the sack firmly round her he"
1448 "lifted her in his arms and strode off with her up the mountain."
1448 "Brigitta was just in time to see him do all this, and on her"
1448 "return to the hut with Peter expressed her astonishment to the"
1448 "grandmother. The latter was equally surprised, and kept on"
1448 "saying, \"God be thanked that he is good to the child, God be"
1448 "thanked! Will he let her come to me again, I wonder! the child"
1448 "has done me so much good. What a loving little heart it is, and"
1448 "how merrily she tells her tale!\" And she continued to dwell with"
1448 "delight on the thought of the child until she went to bed, still"
1448 "saying now and again, \"If only she will come again! Now I have"
1448 "really something left in the world to take pleasure in.\" And"
1448 "Brigitta agreed with all her mother said, and Peter nodded his"
1448 "head in approval each time his grandmother spoke, saying, with a"
1448 "broad smile of satisfaction, \"I told you so!\""

1448 "Meanwhile Heidi was chattering away to her grandfather from"
1448 "inside her sack; her voice, however, could not reach him through"

1448 "impossible to understand a word she was saying, he called to"
1448 "her, \"Wait till we get home, and then you can tell me all about"
1448 "it.\" They had no sooner got inside the hut than Heidi, having"

1448 "nails and fasten grandmother's shutter, and drive in a lot more"
1448 "nails in other places, for her house shakes and rattles all"
1448 "over.\""

1448 "\"We must, must we? who told you that?\" asked her grandfather."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Nobody told me, but I know it for all that,\" replied Heidi,"
1448 "\"for everything is giving way, and when the grandmother cannot"
1448 "sleep, she lies trembling for fear at the noise, for she thinks"
1448 "that every minute the house will fall down on their heads; and"
1448 "everything now is dark for grandmother, and she does not think"
1448 "any one can make it light for her again, but you will be able"
1448 "to, I am sure, grandfather. Think how dreadful it is for her to"
1448 "be always in the dark, and then to be frightened at what may"
1448 "happen, and nobody can help her but you. To-morrow we must go and"
1448 "help her; we will, won't we, grandfather?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The child was clinging to the old man and looking up at him in"
1448 "trustful confidence. The grandfather looked down at Heidi for a"
1448 "while without speaking, and then said, \"Yes, Heidi, we will do"
1448 "something to stop the rattling, at least we can do that; we will"
1448 "go down about it to-morrow!\""

1448 "The child went skipping round the room for joy, crying out, \"We"
1448 "shall go to-morrow! we shall go to-morrow!\""

1448 "The grandfather kept his promise. On the following afternoon he"
1448 "brought the sleigh out again, and as on the previous day, he set"
1448 "Heidi down at the door of the grandmother's hut and said, \"Go in"
1448 "now, and when it grows dark, come out again.\" Then he put the"
1448 "sack in the sleigh and went round the house."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi had hardly opened the door and sprung into the room when"
1448 "the grandmother called out from her corner, \"It's the child"
1448 "again! here she comes!\" and in her delight she let the thread"
1448 "drop from her fingers, and the wheel stood still as she"
1448 "stretched out both her hands in welcome. Heidi ran to her, and"
1448 "then quickly drew the little stool close up to the old woman, and"
1448 "seating herself upon it, began to tell and ask her all kinds of"
1448 "things. All at once came the sound of heavy blows against the"
1448 "wall of the hut and the grandmother gave such a start of alarm"
1448 "that she nearly upset the spinning-wheel, and cried in a"
1448 "trembling voice, \"Ah, my God, now it is coming, the house is"
1448 "going to fall upon us!\" But Heidi caught her by the arm, and said"
1448 "soothingly, \"No, no, grandmother, do not be frightened, it is"
1448 "only grandfather with his hammer; he is mending up everything, so"
1448 "that you shan't have such fear and trouble.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Is it possible! is it really possible! so the dear God has not"
1448 "forgotten us!\" exclaimed the grandmother. \"Do you hear,"
1448 "Brigitta, what that noise is? Did you hear what the child says?"
1448 "Now, as I listen, I can tell it is a hammer; go outside,"
1448 "Brigitta, and if it is Alm-Uncle, tell him he must come inside a"
1448 "moment that I may thank him.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Brigitta went outside and found Alm-Uncle in the act of"
1448 "fastening some heavy pieces of new wood along the wall. She"
1448 "stepped up to him and said, \"Good-evening, Uncle, mother and I"
1448 "have to thank you for doing us such a kind service, and she would"
1448 "like to tell you herself how grateful she is; I do not know who"
1448 "else would have done it for us; we shall not forget your"
1448 "kindness, for I am sure--\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"That will do,\" said the old man, interrupting her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I know what you think of Alm-Uncle without your telling me. Go"
1448 "indoors again, I can find out for myself where the mending is"
1448 "wanted.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Brigitta obeyed on the spot, for Uncle had a way with him that"
1448 "made few people care to oppose his will. He went on knocking"
1448 "with his hammer all round the house, and then mounted the narrow"
1448 "steps to the roof, and hammered away there, until he had used up"
1448 "all the nails he had brought with him. Meanwhile it had been"
1448 "growing dark, and he had hardly come down from the roof and"
1448 "dragged the sleigh out from behind the goat-shed when Heidi"
1448 "appeared outside. The grandfather wrapped her up and took her in"
1448 "his arms as he had done the day before, for although he had to"
1448 "drag the sleigh up the mountain after him, he feared that if the"
1448 "child sat in it alone her wrappings would fall off and that she"
1448 "would be nearly if not quite frozen, so he carried her warm and"
1448 "safe in his arms."
1448 ""
1448 "So the winter went by. After many years of joyless life, the"
1448 "blind grandmother had at last found something to make her happy;"
1448 "her days were no longer passed in weariness and darkness, one"
1448 "like the other without pleasure or change, for now she had"
1448 "always something to which she could look forward. She listened"
1448 "for the little tripping footstep as soon as day had come, and"
1448 "when she heard the door open and knew the child was really there,"
1448 "she would call out, \"God be thanked, she has come again!\" And"
1448 "Heidi would sit by her and talk and tell her everything she knew"
1448 "in so lively a manner that the grandmother never noticed how the"
1448 "time went by, and never now as formerly asked Brigitta, \"Isn't"
1448 "the day done yet?\" but as the child shut the door behind her on"
1448 "leaving, would exclaim, \"How short the afternoon has seemed;"
1448 "don't you think so, Brigitta?\" And this one would answer, \"I do"
1448 "indeed; it seems as if I had only just cleared away the mid-day"
1448 "meal.\" And the grandmother would continue, \"Pray God the child is"
1448 "not taken from me, and that Alm-Uncle continues to let her come!"
1448 "Does she look well and strong, Brigitta?\" And the latter would"
1448 "answer, \"She looks as bright and rosy as an apple.\""
1448 ""
1448 "And Heidi had also grown very fond of the old grandmother, and"
1448 "when at last she knew for certain that no one could make it"
1448 "light for her again, she was overcome with sorrow; but the"
1448 "grandmother told her again that she felt the darkness much less"
1448 "when Heidi was with her, and so every fine winter's day the child"
1448 "came travelling down in her sleigh. The grandfather always took"
1448 "her, never raising any objection, indeed he always carried the"
1448 "hammer and sundry other things down in the sleigh with him, and"
1448 "many an afternoon was spent by him in making the goatherd's"
1448 "cottage sound and tight. It no longer groaned and rattled the"
1448 "whole night through, and the grandmother, who for many winters"
1448 "had not been able to sleep in peace as she did now, said she"

1448 "When the March sun had melted the snow on the mountain side and"

1448 "waving their branches in the air, Heidi ran backwards and"
1448 "forwards with delight first to the goat-shed then to the fir-"
1448 "trees, and then to the hut-door, in order to let her grandfather"
1448 "know how much larger a piece of green there was under the trees,"

1448 ""
1448 "\"She will do no such thing,\" said the old man with calm"
1448 "determination."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you mean that by no persuasion can you be brought to see"
1448 "reason, and that you intend to stick obstinately to your"
1448 "decision?\" said the pastor, growing somewhat angry. \"You have"
1448 "been about the world, and must have seen and learnt much, and I"
1448 "should have given you credit for more sense, neighbor.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Indeed,\" replied the old man, and there was a tone in his voice"
1448 "that betrayed a growing irritation on his part too, \"and does"
1448 "the worthy pastor really mean that he would wish me next winter"
1448 "to send a young child like that some miles down the mountain on"
1448 "ice-cold mornings through storm and snow, and let her return at"
1448 "night when the wind is raging, when even one like ourselves"
1448 "would run a risk of being blown down by it and buried in the"
1448 "snow? And perhaps he may not have forgotten the child's mother,"
1448 "Adelaide? She was a sleep-walker, and had fits. Might not the"
1448 "child be attacked in the same way if obliged to over-exert"
1448 "herself? And some one thinks they can come and force me to send"
1448 "her? I will go before all the courts of justice in the country,"
1448 "and then we shall see who will force me to do it!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You are quite right, neighbor,\" said the pastor in a friendly"
1448 "tone of voice. \"I see it would have been impossible to send the"
1448 "child to school from here. But I perceive that the child is dear"
1448 "to you; for her sake do what you ought to have done long ago:"
1448 "come down into Dorfli and live again among your fellowmen. What"
1448 "sort of a life is this you lead, alone, and with bitter thoughts"
1448 "towards God and man! If anything were to happen to you up here"
1448 "who would there be to help you? I cannot think but what you must"
1448 "be half-frozen to death in this hut in the winter, and I do not"
1448 "know how the child lives through it!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"The child has young blood in her veins and a good roof over her"
1448 "head, and let me further tell the pastor, that I know where wood"
1448 "is to be found, and when is the proper time to fetch it; the"
1448 "pastor can go and look inside my wood-shed; the fire is never"
1448 "out in my hut the whole winter through. As to going to live below"
1448 "that is far from my thoughts; the people despise me and I them;"
1448 "it is therefore best for all of us that we live apart.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, no, it is not best for you; I know what it is you lack,\""
1448 "said the pastor in an earnest voice. \"As to the people down"
1448 "there looking on you with dislike, it is not as bad as you think."
1448 "Believe me, neighbor; seek to make your peace with God, pray for"
1448 "forgiveness where you need it, and then come and see how"
1448 "differently people will look upon you, and how happy you may yet"
1448 "be.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The pastor had risen and stood holding out his hand to the old"
1448 "man as he added with renewed earnestness, \"I will wager,"
1448 "neighbor, that next winter you will be down among us again, and"
1448 "we shall be good neighbors as of old. I should be very grieved"
1448 "if any pressure had to be put upon you; give me your hand and"
1448 "promise me that you will come and live with us again and become"
1448 "reconciled to God and man.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Alm-Uncle gave the pastor his hand and answered him calmly and"
1448 "firmly, \"You mean well by me I know, but as to that which you"
1448 "wish me to do, I say now what I shall continue to say, that I"
1448 "will not send the child to school nor come and live among you.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Then God help you!\" said the pastor, and he turned sadly away"
1448 "and left the hut and went down the mountain."
1448 ""
1448 "Alm-Uncle was out of humor. When Heidi said as usual that"
1448 "afternoon, \"Can we go down to grandmother now?\" he answered,"
1448 "\"Not to-day.\" He did not speak again the whole of that day, and"
1448 "the following morning when Heidi again asked the same question,"
1448 "he replied, \"We will see.\" But before the dinner bowls had been"
1448 "cleared away another visitor arrived, and this time it was"
1448 "Cousin Dete. She had a fine feathered hat on her head, and a long"
1448 "trailing skirt to her dress which swept the floor, and on the"
1448 "floor of a goatherd's hut there are all sorts of things that do"
1448 "not belong to a dress."
1448 ""
1448 "The grandfather looked her up and down without uttering a word."
1448 "But Dete was prepared with an exceedingly amiable speech and"
1448 "began at once to praise the looks of the child. She was looking"
1448 "so well she should hardly have known her again, and it was"
1448 "evident that she had been happy and well-cared for with her"
1448 "grandfather; but she had never lost sight of the idea of taking"
1448 "the child back again, for she well understood that the little"
1448 "one must be much in his way, but she had not been able to do it"
1448 "at first. Day and night, however, she had thought over the means"
1448 "of placing the child somewhere, and that was why she had come to-"
1448 "day, for she had just heard of something that would be a lucky"
1448 "chance for Heidi beyond her most ambitious hopes. Some immensely"
1448 "wealthy relatives of the people she was serving, who had the"
1448 "most splendid house almost in Frankfurt, had an only daughter,"
1448 "young and an invalid, who was always obliged to go about in a"
1448 "wheeled chair; she was therefore very much alone and had no one"
1448 "to share her lessons, and so the little girl felt dull. Her"
1448 "father had spoken to Dete's mistress about finding a companion"
1448 "for her, and her mistress was anxious to help in the matter, as"
1448 "she felt so sympathetic about it. The lady-housekeeper had"
1448 "described the sort of child they wanted, simple-minded and"
1448 "unspoilt, and not like most of the children that one saw now-a-"
1448 "days. Dete had thought at once of Heidi and had gone off without"
1448 "delay to see the lady-housekeeper, and after Dete had given her a"
1448 "description of Heidi, she had immediately agreed to take her. And"
1448 "no one could tell what good fortune there might not be in store"
1448 "for Heidi, for if she was once with these people and they took a"
1448 "fancy to her, and anything happened to their own daughter--one"
1448 "could never tell, the child was so weakly--and they did not feel"
1448 "they could live without a child, why then the most unheard of"
1448 "luck--"
1448 ""
1448 "\"Have you nearly finished what you had to say?\" broke in Alm-"
1448 "Uncle, who had allowed her to talk on uninterruptedly so far."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ugh!\" exclaimed Dete, throwing up her head in disgust, \"one"
1448 "would think I had been talking to you about the most ordinary"
1448 "matter; why there is not one person in all Prattigau who would"
1448 "not thank God if I were to bring them such a piece of news as I"
1448 "am bringing you.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You may take your news to anybody you like, I will have nothing"
1448 "to do with it.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But now Dete leaped up from her seat like a rocket and cried,"
1448 "\"If that is all you have to say about it, why then I will give"
1448 "you a bit of my mind. The child is now eight years old and knows"
1448 "nothing, and you will not let her learn. You will not send her"
1448 "to church or school, as I was told down in Dorfli, and she is my"
1448 "own sister's child. I am responsible for what happens to her, and"
1448 "when there is such a good opening for a child, as this which"
1448 "offers for Heidi, only a person who cares for nobody and never"
1448 "wishes good to any one would think of not jumping at it. But I"
1448 "am not going to give in, and that I tell you; I have everybody in"
1448 "Dorfli on my side; there is not one person there who will not"
1448 "take my part against you; and I advise you to think well before"
1448 "bringing it into court, if that is your intention; there are"
1448 "certain things which might be brought up against you which you"
1448 "would not care to hear, for when one has to do with law-courts"
1448 "there is a great deal raked up that had been forgotten.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Be silent!\" thundered the Uncle, and his eyes flashed with"
1448 "anger. \"Go and be done with you! and never let me see you again"
1448 "with your hat and feather, and such words on your tongue as you"
1448 "come with today!\" And with that he strode out of the hut."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You have made grandfather angry,\" said Heidi, and her dark eyes"
1448 "had anything but a friendly expression in them as she looked at"
1448 "Dete."
1448 ""
1448 "\"He will soon be all right again; come now,\" said Dete"
1448 "hurriedly, \"and show me where your clothes are.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am not coming,\" said Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Nonsense,\" continued Dete; then altering her tone to one half-"
1448 "coaxing, half-cross, \"Come, come, you do not understand any"
1448 "better than your grandfather; you will have all sorts of good"
1448 "things that you never dreamed of.\" Then she went to the cupboard"
1448 "and taking out Heidi's things rolled them up in a bundle. \"Come"
1448 "along now, there's your hat; it is very shabby but will do for"
1448 "the present; put it on and let us make haste off.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am not coming,\" repeated Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Don't be so stupid and obstinate, like a goat; I suppose it's"
1448 "from the goats you have learnt to be so. Listen to me: you saw"
1448 "your grandfather was angry and heard what he said, that he did"
1448 "not wish to see us ever again; he wants you now to go away with"
1448 "me and you must not make him angrier still. You can't think how"
1448 "nice it is at Frankfurt, and what a lot of things you will see,"
1448 "and if you do not like it you can come back again; your"
1448 "grandfather will be in a good temper again by that time.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Can I return at once and be back home again here this evening?\""
1448 "asked Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What are you talking about, come along now! I tell you that you"
1448 "can come back here when you like. To-day we shall go as far as"
1448 "Mayenfeld, and early to-morrow we shall start in the train, and"
1448 "that will bring you home again in no time when you wish it, for"
1448 "it goes as fast as the wind.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Dete had now got the bundle under her arm and the child by the"
1448 "hand, and so they went down the mountain together."
1448 ""
1448 "As it was still too early in the year to take his goats out,"
1448 "Peter continued to go to school at Dorfli, but now and again he"
1448 "stole a holiday, for he could see no use in learning to read,"
1448 "while to wander about a bit and look for stout sticks which"
1448 "might be wanted some day he thought a far better employment. As"
1448 "Dete and Heidi neared the grandmother's hut they met Peter coming"
1448 "round the corner; he had evidently been well rewarded that day"
1448 "for his labors, for he was carrying an immense bundle of long"
1448 "thick hazel sticks on his shoulders. He stood still and stared"
1448 "at the two approaching figures; as they came up to him, he"
1448 "exclaimed, \"Where are you going, Heidi?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am only just going over to Frankfurt for a little visit with"
1448 "Dete,\" she replied; \"but I must first run in to grandmother, she"
1448 "will be expecting me.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, no, you must not stop to talk; it is already too late,\""
1448 "said Dete, holding Heidi, who was struggling to get away, fast by"
1448 "the hand. \"You can go in when you come back, you must come along"
1448 "now,\" and she pulled the child on with her, fearing that if she"
1448 "let her go in Heidi might take it into her head again that she"
1448 "did not wish to come, and that the grandmother might stand by"
1448 "her. Peter ran into the hut and banged against the table with"
1448 "his bundle of sticks with such violence that everything in the"
1448 "room shook, and his grandmother leaped up with a cry of alarm"
1448 "from her spinning-wheel. Peter had felt that he must give vent to"
1448 "his feelings somehow."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What is the matter? What is the matter?\" cried the frightened"
1448 "old woman, while his mother, who had also started up from her"
1448 "seat at the shock, said in her usual patient manner, \"What is"
1448 "it, Peter? why do you behave so roughly?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Because she is taking Heidi away,\" explained Peter."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Who? who? where to, Peter, where to?\" asked the grandmother,"
1448 "growing still more agitated; but even as she spoke she guessed"
1448 "what had happened, for Brigitta had told her shortly before that"
1448 "she had seen Dete going up to Alm-Uncle. The old woman rose"
1448 "hastily and with trembling hands opened the window and called"
1448 "out beseechingly, \"Dete, Dete, do not take the child away from"
1448 "us! do not take her away!\""
1448 ""
1448 "The two who were hastening down the mountain heard her voice,"
1448 "and Dete evidently caught the words, for she grasped Heidi's hand"
1448 "more firmly. Heidi struggled to get free, crying, \"Grandmother"
1448 "is calling, I must go to her.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But Dete had no intention of letting the child go, and quieted"
1448 "her as best she could; they must make haste now, she said, or"
1448 "they would be too late and not able to go on the next day to"
1448 "Frankfurt, and there the child would see how delightful it was,"
1448 "and Dete was sure would not wish to go back when she was once"
1448 "there. But if Heidi wanted to return home she could do so at"
1448 "once, and then she could take something she liked back to"
1448 "grandmother. This was a new idea to Heidi, and it pleased her so"
1448 "much that Dete had no longer any difficulty in getting her"
1448 "along."
1448 ""
1448 "After a few minutes' silence, Heidi asked, \"What could I take"
1448 "back to her?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"We must think of something nice,\" answered Dete; \"a soft roll"
1448 "of white bread; she would enjoy that, for now she is old she can"
1448 "hardly eat the hard, black bread.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, she always gives it back to Peter, telling him it is too"
1448 "hard, for I have seen her do it myself,\" affirmed Heidi. \"Do let"
1448 "us make haste, for then perhaps we can get back soon from"
1448 "Frankfurt, and I shall be able to give her the white bread to-"
1448 "day.\" And Heidi started off running so fast that Dete with the"
1448 "bundle under her arm could scarcely keep up with her. But she"
1448 "was glad, nevertheless, to get along so quickly, for they were"
1448 "nearing Dorfli, where her friends would probably talk and"
1448 "question in a way that might put other ideas into Heidi's head."
1448 "So she went on straight ahead through the village, holding Heidi"
1448 "tightly by the hand, so that they might all see that it was on"
1448 "the child's account she was hurrying along at such a rate. To"
1448 "all their questions and remarks she made answer as she passed \"I"
1448 "can't stop now, as you see, I must make haste with the child as"
1448 "we have yet some way to go.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Are you taking her away?\" \"Is she running away from Alm-Uncle?\""
1448 "\"It's a wonder she is still alive!\" \"But what rosy cheeks she"
1448 "has!\" Such were the words which rang out on all sides, and Dete"
1448 "was thankful that she had not to stop and give any distinct"
1448 "answers to them, while Heidi hurried eagerly forward without"
1448 "saying a word."
1448 ""
1448 "From that day forward Alm-Uncle looked fiercer and more"
1448 "forbidding than ever when he came down and passed through"
1448 "Dorfli. He spoke to no one, and looked such an ogre as he came"
1448 "along with his pack of cheeses on his back, his immense stick in"
1448 "his hand, and his thick, frowning eyebrows, that the women would"
1448 "call to their little ones, \"Take care! get out of Alm-Uncle's way"
1448 "or he may hurt you!\""
1448 ""
1448 "The old man took no notice of anybody as he strode through the"
1448 "village on his way to the valley below, where he sold his"
1448 "cheeses and bought what bread and meat he wanted for himself."
1448 "After he had passed the villagers all crowded together looking"
1448 "after him, and each had something to say about him; how much"
1448 "wilder he looked than usual, how now he would not even respond to"
1448 "anybody's greeting, while they all agreed that it was a great"
1448 "mercy the child had got away from him, and had they not all"
1448 "noticed how the child had hurried along as if afraid that her"
1448 "grandfather might be following to take her back? Only the blind"
1448 "grandmother would have nothing to say against him, and told those"
1448 "who came to her to bring her work, or take away what she had"
1448 "spun, how kind and thoughtful he had been with the child, how"
1448 "good to her and her daughter, and how many afternoons he had"
1448 "spent mending the house which, but for his help, would certainly"
1448 "by this time have fallen down over their heads. And all this was"
1448 "repeated down in Dorfli; but most of the people who heard it said"
1448 "that grandmother was too old to understand, and very likely had"
1448 "not heard rightly what was said; as she was blind she was"
1448 "probably also deaf."
1448 ""
1448 "Alm-Uncle went no more now to the grandmother's house, and it"
1448 "was well that he had made it so safe, for it was not touched"
1448 "again for a long time. The days were sad again now for the old"
1448 "blind woman, and not one passed but what she would murmur"
1448 "complainingly, \"Alas! all our happiness and pleasure have gone"
1448 "with the child, and now the days are so long and dreary! Pray"
1448 "God, I see Heidi again once more before I die!\""

1448 "In her home at Frankfurt, Clara, the little daughter of Herr"
1448 "Sesemann, was lying on the invalid couch on which she spent her"
1448 "whole day, being wheeled in it from room to room. Just now she"
1448 "was in what was known as the study, where, to judge by the"
1448 "various things standing and lying about, which added to the cosy"
1448 "appearance of the room, the family was fond of sitting. A"
1448 "handsome bookcase with glass doors explained why it was called"
1448 "the study, and here evidently the little girl was accustomed to"
1448 "have her lessons."
1448 ""
1448 "Clara's little face was thin and pale, and at this moment her"
1448 "two soft blue eyes were fixed on the clock, which seemed to her"
1448 "to go very slowly this day, and with a slight accent of"
1448 "impatience, which was very rare with her, she asked, \"Isn't it"
1448 "time yet, Fraulein Rottenmeier?\""
1448 ""
1448 "This lady was sitting very upright at a small work-table, busy"
1448 "with her embroidery. She had on a mysterious-looking loose"
1448 "garment, a large collar or shoulder-cape that gave a certain"
1448 "solemnity to her appearance, which was enhanced by a very lofty"
1448 "dome-shaped head dress. For many years past, since the mistress"
1448 "of the house had died, the housekeeping and the superintendence"
1448 "of the servants had been entrusted by Herr Sesemann to Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier. He himself was often away from home, and he left"
1448 "her in sole charge, with the condition only that his little"
1448 "daughter should have a voice in all matters, and that nothing"
1448 "should be done against her wish."
1448 ""
1448 "As Clara was putting her impatient question for the second time,"
1448 "Dete and Heidi arrived at the front door, and the former"

1448 "it was too late to see Fraulein Rottenmeier."

1448 "the first time in a gentleman's house and she does not know good"
1448 "manners; but she is docile and very willing to learn, if the"

1448 "\"Well, that's a name that one can pronounce,\" remarked Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier. \"But I must tell you, Dete, that I am astonished to"
1448 "see so young a child. I told you that I wanted a companion of"
1448 "the same age as the young lady of the house, one who could share"
1448 "her lessons, and all her other occupations. Fraulein Clara is now"
1448 "over twelve; what age is this child?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"If the lady will allow me,\" began Dete again, in her usual"
1448 "fluent manner, \"I myself had lost count of her exact age; she is"
1448 "certainly a little younger, but not much; I cannot say"
1448 "precisely, but I think she is ten, or thereabouts.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Grandfather told me I was eight,\" put in Heidi. Dete gave her"
1448 "another poke, but as the child had not the least idea why she"
1448 "did so she was not at all confused."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What--only eight!\" cried Fraulein Rottenmeier angrily. \"Four"
1448 "years too young! Of what use is such a child! And what have you"
1448 "learnt? What books did you have to learn from?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"None,\" said Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"How? what? How then did you learn to read?\" continued the lady."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I have never learnt to read, or Peter either,\" Heidi informed"
1448 "her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Mercy upon us! you do not know how to read! Is it really so?\""
1448 "exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, greatly horrified. \"Is it"
1448 "possible--not able to read? What have you learnt then?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Nothing,\" said Heidi with unflinching truthfulness."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Young woman,\" said the lady to Dete, after having paused for a"
1448 "minute or two to recover from her shock, \"this is not at all the"
1448 "sort of companion you led me to suppose; how could you think of"
1448 "bringing me a child like this?\""
1448 ""
1448 "But Dete was not to be put down so easily, and answered warmly,"
1448 "\"If the lady will allow me, the child is exactly what I thought"
1448 "she required; the lady described what she wished for, a child"
1448 "unlike all other children, and I could find no other to suit,"
1448 "for the greater number I know are not peculiar, but one very much"
1448 "the same as the other, and I thought this child seemed as if made"
1448 "for the place. But I must go now, for my mistress will be waiting"
1448 "for me; if the lady will permit I will come again soon and see"
1448 "how she is getting on.\" And with a bow Dete quickly left the room"
1448 "and ran downstairs. Fraulein Rottenmeier stood for a moment taken"
1448 "aback and then ran after Dete. If the child was to stop she had"
1448 "many things yet to say and ask about her, and there the child"
1448 "was, and what was more, Dete, as she plainly saw, meant to leave"
1448 "her there."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi remained by the door where she had been standing since she"
1448 "first came in. Clara had looked on during the interview without"
1448 "speaking; now she beckoned to Heidi and said, \"Come here!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi went up to her."

1448 "\"Would you rather be called Heidi or Adelaide?\" asked Clara."

1448 "\"I am never called anything but Heidi,\" was the child's prompt"
1448 "answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Then I shall always call you by that name,\" said Clara, \"it"
1448 "suits you. I have never heard it before, but neither have I ever"
1448 "seen a child like you before. Have you always had that short"
1448 "curly hair?\""

1448 "\"Yes, I think so,\" said Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Are you pleased to come to Frankfurt?\" went on Clara."
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, but I shall go home to-morrow and take grandmother a white"

1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, you are a funny child!\" exclaimed Clara. \"You were"
1448 "expressly sent for to come here and to remain with me and share"
1448 "my lessons; there will be some fun about them now as you cannot"
1448 "read, something new to do, for often they are dreadfully dull,"
1448 "and I think the morning will never pass away. You know my tutor"
1448 "comes every morning at about ten o'clock, and then we go on with"
1448 "lessons till two, and it does seem such a long time. Sometimes"
1448 "he takes up the book and holds it close up to his face, as if he"
1448 "was very short-sighted, but I know it's only because he wants so"
1448 "dreadfully to gape, and Fraulein Rottenmeier takes her large"
1448 "handkerchief out also now and then and covers her face with it,"
1448 "as if she was moved by what we had been reading, but that is"
1448 "only because she is longing to gape too. And I myself often want"
1448 "to gape, but I am obliged to stop myself, for if Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier sees me gaping she runs off at once and fetches the"
1448 "cod-liver oil and says I must have a dose, as I am getting weak"
1448 "again, and the cod-liver oil is horrible, so I do my best not to"
1448 "gape. But now it will be much more amusing, for I shall be able"
1448 "to lie and listen while you learn to read.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi shook her head doubtfully when she heard of learning to"
1448 "read."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, nonsense, Heidi, of course you must learn to read,"
1448 "everybody must, and my tutor is very kind, and never cross, and"
1448 "he will explain everything to you. But mind, when he explains"
1448 "anything to you, you won't be able to understand; but don't ask"
1448 "any questions, or else he will go on explaining and you will"
1448 "understand less than ever. Later when you have learnt more and"
1448 "know about things yourself, then you will begin to understand"
1448 "what he meant.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier now came back into the room; she had not"
1448 "been able to overtake Dete, and was evidently very much put out;"
1448 "for she had wanted to go into more details concerning the child,"
1448 "and to convince Dete how misleading she had been, and how unfit"
1448 "Heidi was as a companion for Clara; she really did not know what"
1448 "to be about, or how to undo the mischief, and it made her all"
1448 "the more angry that she herself was responsible for it, having"
1448 "consented to Heidi being fetched. She ran backwards and forwards"
1448 "in a state of agitation between the study and the dining-room,"
1448 "and then began scolding Sebastian, who was standing looking at"
1448 "the table he had just finished laying to see that nothing was"
1448 "missing."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You can finish your thoughts to-morrow morning; make haste, or"
1448 "we shall get no dinner to-day at all.\""

1448 "Then hurrying out she called Tinette, but in such an ill-"
1448 "tempered voice that the maid came tripping forward with even more"
1448 "mincing steps than usual, but she looked so pert that even"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier did not venture to scold her, which only"
1448 "made her suppressed anger the greater."
1448 ""
1448 "\"See that the room is prepared for the little girl who has just"
1448 "arrived,\" said the lady, with a violent effort at self-control."
1448 "\"Everything is ready; it only wants dusting.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"It's worth my troubling about,\" said Tinette mockingly as she"
1448 "turned away."
1448 ""
1448 "Meanwhile Sebastian had flung open the folding doors leading"
1448 "into the dining-room with rather more noise than he need, for he"
1448 "was feeling furious, although he did not dare answer back when"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier spoke to him; he then went up to Clara's"
1448 "chair to wheel her into the next room. As he was arranging the"
1448 "handle at the back preparatory to doing so, Heidi went near and"
1448 "stood staring at him. Seeing her eyes fixed upon him, he"
1448 "suddenly growled out, \"Well, what is there in me to stare at like"
1448 "that?\" which he would certainly not have done if he had been"
1448 "aware that Fraulein Rottenmeier was just then entering the room."
1448 "\"You look so like Peter,\" answered Heidi. The lady-housekeeper"
1448 "clasped her hands in horror. \"Is it possible!\" she stammered half-"
1448 "aloud, \"she is now addressing the servant as if he were a friend!"
1448 "I never could have imagined such a child!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Sebastian wheeled the couch into the dining-room and helped"
1448 "Clara on to her chair. Fraulein Rottenmeier took the seat beside"
1448 "her and made a sign to Heidi to take the one opposite. They were"
1448 "the only three at table, and as they sat far apart there was"
1448 "plenty of room for Sebastian to hand his dishes. Beside Heidi's"
1448 "plate lay a nice white roll, and her eyes lighted up with"
1448 "pleasure as she saw it. The resemblance which Heidi had noticed"
1448 "had evidently awakened in her a feeling of confidence towards"
1448 "Sebastian, for she sat as still as a mouse and without moving"
1448 "until he came up to her side and handed her the dish of fish;"
1448 "then she looked at the roll and asked, \"Can I have it?\" Sebastian"
1448 "nodded, throwing a side glance at Fraulein Rottenmeier to see"
1448 "what effect this request would have upon her. Heidi immediately"
1448 "seized the roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian's face became"
1448 "convulsed, he was overcome with inward laughter but knew his"
1448 "place too well to laugh aloud. Mute and motionless he still"
1448 "remained standing beside Heidi; it was not his duty to speak, nor"
1448 "to move away until she had helped herself. Heidi looked"
1448 "wonderingly at him for a minute or two, and then said, \"Am I to"
1448 "eat some of that too?\" Sebastian nodded again. \"Give me some"
1448 "then,\" she said, looking calmly at her plate. At this Sebastian's"
1448 "command of his countenance became doubtful, and the dish began to"
1448 "tremble suspiciously in his hands."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You can put the dish on the table and come back presently,\""
1448 "said Fraulein Rottenmeier with a severe expression of face."
1448 "Sebastian disappeared on the spot. \"As for you, Adelaide, I see I"
1448 "shall have to teach you the first rules of behavior,\" continued"
1448 "the lady-housekeeper with a sigh. \"I will begin by explaining to"
1448 "you how you are to conduct yourself at table,\" and she went on to"
1448 "give Heidi minute instructions as to all she was to do. \"And"
1448 "now,\" she continued, \"I must make you particularly understand"
1448 "that you are not to speak to Sebastian at table, or at any other"
1448 "time, unless you have an order to give him, or a necessary"
1448 "question to put to him; and then you are not to address him as"
1448 "if he was some one belonging to you. Never let me hear you speak"
1448 "to him in that way again! It is the same with Tinette, and for"
1448 "myself you are to address me as you hear others doing. Clara"
1448 "must herself decide what you are to call her.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why, Clara, of course,\" put the latter. Then followed a long"
1448 "list of rules as to general behavior, getting up and going to"
1448 "bed, going in and out of the room, shutting the doors, keeping"
1448 "everything tidy, during the course of which Heidi's eyes"
1448 "gradually closed, for she had been up before five o'clock that"
1448 "morning and had had a long journey. She leant back in her chair"
1448 "and fell fast asleep. Fraulein Rottenmeier having at last come"
1448 "to the end of her sermonizing said, \"Now remember what I have"
1448 "said, Adelaide! Have you understood it all?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Heidi has been asleep for ever so long,\" said Clara, her face"
1448 "rippling all over with amusement, for she had not had such an"
1448 "entertaining dinner for a long time."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It is really insupportable what one has to go through with this"
1448 "child,\" exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, in great indignation,"
1448 "and she rang the bell so violently that Tinette and Sebastian"
1448 "both came running in and nearly tumbling over one another; but no"
1448 "noise was sufficient to wake Heidi, and it was with difficulty"
1448 "they could rouse her sufficiently to get her along to her"
1448 "bedroom, to reach which she had to pass first through the study,"
1448 "then through Clara's bedroom, then through Fraulein Rottenmeier's"
1448 "sitting-room, till she came to the corner room that had been set"
1448 "apart for her."

1448 ""
1448 "When Heidi opened her eyes on her first morning in Frankfurt she"
1448 "could not think where she was. Then she rubbed them and looked"
1448 "about her. She was sitting up in a high white bed, on one side"
1448 "of a large, wide room, into which the light was falling through"
1448 "very, very long white curtains; near the window stood two chairs"
1448 "covered with large flowers, and then came a sofa with the same"
1448 "flowers, in front of which was a round table; in the corner was"
1448 "a washstand, with things upon it that Heidi had never seen in her"
1448 "life before. But now all at once she remembered that she was in"
1448 "Frankfurt; everything that had happened the day before came back"
1448 "to her, and finally she recalled clearly the instructions that"
1448 "had been given her by the lady-housekeeper, as far as she had"
1448 "heard them. Heidi jumped out of bed and dressed herself; then"
1448 "she ran first to one window and then another; she wanted to see"
1448 "the sky and country outside; she felt like a bird in a cage"
1448 "behind those great curtains. But they were too heavy for her to"
1448 "put aside, so she crept underneath them to get to the window. But"
1448 "these again were so high that she could only just get her head"
1448 "above the sill to peer out. Even then she could not see what she"
1448 "longed for. In vain she went first to one and then the other of"
1448 "the windows--she could see nothing but walls and windows and"
1448 "again walls and windows. Heidi felt quite frightened. It was"
1448 "still early, for Heidi was accustomed to get up early and run"
1448 "out at once to see how everything was looking, if the sky was"
1448 "blue and if the sun was already above the mountains, or if the"
1448 "fir trees were waving and the flowers had opened their eyes. As a"
1448 "bird, when it first finds itself in its bright new cage, darts"
1448 "hither and thither, trying the bars in turn to see if it cannot"
1448 "get through them and fly again into the open, so Heidi continued"
1448 "to run backwards and forwards, trying to open first one and then"
1448 "the other of the windows, for she felt she could not bear to see"
1448 "nothing but walls and windows, and somewhere outside there must"
1448 "be the green grass, and the last unmelted snows on the mountain"
1448 "slopes, which Heidi so longed to see. But the windows remained"
1448 "immovable, try what Heidi would to open them, even endeavoring"
1448 "to push her little fingers under them to lift them up; but it was"
1448 "all no use. When after a while Heidi saw that her efforts were"
1448 "fruitless, she gave up trying, and began to think whether she"
1448 "would not go out and round the house till she came to the grass,"
1448 "but then she remembered that the night before she had only seen"
1448 "stones in front of the house. At that moment a knock came to the"
1448 "door, and immediately after Tinette put her head inside and"
1448 "said, \"Breakfast is ready.\" Heidi had no idea what an invitation"
1448 "so worded meant, and Tinette's face did not encourage any"
1448 "questioning on Heidi's part, but rather the reverse. Heidi was"
1448 "sharp enough to read its expression, and acted accordingly. So"
1448 "she drew the little stool out from under the table, put it in"
1448 "the corner and sat down upon it, and there silently awaited what"
1448 "would happen next. Shortly after, with a good deal of rustling"
1448 "and bustling Fraulein Rottenmeier appeared, who again seemed"
1448 "very much put out and called to Heidi, \"What is the matter with"
1448 "you, Adelheid? Don't you understand what breakfast is? Come along"
1448 "at once!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi had no difficulty in understanding now and followed at"
1448 "once. Clara had been some time at the breakfast table and she"
1448 "gave Heidi a kindly greeting, her face looking considerably more"
1448 "cheerful than usual, for she looked forward to all kinds of new"
1448 "things happening again that day. Breakfast passed off quietly;"
1448 "Heidi ate her bread and butter in a perfectly correct manner,"
1448 "and when the meal was over and Clara wheeled back into the study,"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier told her to follow and remain with Clara"
1448 "until the tutor should arrive and lessons begin."
1448 ""
1448 "As soon as the children were alone again, Heidi asked, \"How can"
1448 "one see out from here, and look right down on to the ground?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You must open the window and look out,\" replied Clara amused."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But the windows won't open,\" responded Heidi sadly."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, they will,\" Clara assured her. \"You cannot open them, nor"
1448 "I either, but when you see Sebastian you can ask him to open"
1448 "one.\""
1448 ""
1448 "It was a great relief to Heidi to know that the windows could be"
1448 "opened and that one could look out, for she still felt as if she"
1448 "was shut up in prison. Clara now began to ask her questions"
1448 "about her home, and Heidi was delighted to tell her all about the"
1448 "mountain and the goats, and the flowery meadows which were so"
1448 "dear to her."
1448 ""
1448 "Meanwhile her tutor had arrived; Fraulein Rottenmeier, however,"
1448 "did not bring him straight into the study but drew him first"
1448 "aside into the dining-room, where she poured forth her troubles"
1448 "and explained to him the awkward position in which she was"
1448 "placed, and how it had all come about. It appeared that she had"
1448 "written some time back to Herr Sesemann to tell him that his"
1448 "daughter very much wished to have a companion, and had added how"
1448 "desirable she thought it herself, as it would be a spur to Clara"
1448 "at her lessons and an amusement for her in her playtime."
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier had privately wished for this arrangement on"
1448 "her own behalf, as it would relieve her from having always to"
1448 "entertain the sick girl herself, which she felt at times was too"
1448 "much for her. The father had answered that he was quite willing"
1448 "to let his daughter have a companion, provided she was treated in"
1448 "every way like his own child, as he would not have any child"
1448 "tormented or put upon, \"which was a very unnecessary remark,\" put"
1448 "in Fraulein Rottenmeier, \"for who wants to torment children!\" But"
1448 "now she went on to explain how dreadfully she had been taken in"
1448 "about the child, and related all the unimaginable things of which"
1448 "she had already been guilty, so that not only would he have to"
1448 "begin with teaching her the A B C, but would have to start with"
1448 "the most rudimentary instruction as regarded everything to do"
1448 "with daily life. She could see only one way out of this"
1448 "disastrous state of affairs, and that was for the tutor to"
1448 "declare that it was impossible for the two to learn together"
1448 "without detriment to Clara, who was so far ahead of the other;"
1448 "that would be a valid excuse for getting rid of the child, and"
1448 "Herr Sesemann would be sure to agree to the child being sent home"
1448 "again, but she dared not do this without his order, since he was"
1448 "aware that by this time the companion had arrived. But the tutor"
1448 "was a cautious man and not inclined to take a partial view of"
1448 "matters. He tried to calm Fraulein Rottenmeier, and gave it as"
1448 "his opinion that if the little girl was backward in some things"
1448 "she was probably advanced in others, and a little regular"
1448 "teaching would soon set the balance right. When Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier saw that he was not ready to support her, and"
1448 "evidently quite ready to undertake teaching the alphabet, she"
1448 "opened the study door, which she quickly shut again as soon as he"
1448 "had gone through, remaining on the other side herself, for she"
1448 "had a perfect horror of the A B C. She walked up and down the"
1448 "dining-room, thinking over in her own mind how the servants were"
1448 "to be told to address Adelaide. The father had written that she"
1448 "was to be treated exactly like his own daughter, and this would"
1448 "especially refer, she imagined, to the servants. She was not"
1448 "allowed, however, a very long interval of time for consideration,"
1448 "for suddenly the sound of a frightful crash was heard in the"
1448 "study, followed by frantic cries for Sebastian. She rushed into"
1448 "the room. There on the floor lay in a confused heap, books,"
1448 "exercise-books, inkstand, and other articles with the table-cloth"
1448 "on the top, while from beneath them a dark stream of ink was"
1448 "flowing all across the floor. Heidi had disappeared."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Here's a state of things!\" exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier,"
1448 "wringing her hands. \"Table-cloth, books, work-basket, everything"
1448 "lying in the ink! It was that unfortunate child, I suppose!\""
1448 ""
1448 "The tutor was standing looking down at the havoc in distress;"
1448 "there was certainly only one view to be taken of such a matter"
1448 "as this and that an unfavorable one. Clara meanwhile appeared to"
1448 "find pleasure in such an unusual event and in watching the"
1448 "results. \"Yes, Heidi did it,\" she explained, \"but quite by"
1448 "accident; she must on no account be punished; she jumped up in"
1448 "such violent haste to get away that she dragged the tablecloth"
1448 "along with her, and so everything went over. There were a number"
1448 "of vehicles passing, that is why she rushed off like that;"
1448 "perhaps she has never seen a carriage.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Is it not as I said? She has not the smallest notion about"
1448 "anything! not the slightest idea that she ought to sit still and"
1448 "listen while her lessons are going on. But where is the child"
1448 "who has caused all this trouble? Surely she has not run away!"
1448 "What would Herr Sesemann say to me?\" She ran out of the room and"
1448 "down the stairs. There, at the bottom, standing in the open door-"
1448 "way, was Heidi, looking in amazement up and down the street."

1448 "looking disappointedly in the direction whence the noise of the"
1448 "passing carriages had reached her, and which to Heidi had seemed"
1448 "like the blowing of the south wind in the trees, so that in"
1448 "great joy of heart she had rushed out to look at them."

1448 "\"I excuse you doing this as it is the first time, but do not let"

1448 "\"Yes,\" replied Heidi, \"but I will certainly not move again,\" for"
1448 "now she understood that it was a rule to sit still while she was"
1448 "being taught."
1448 ""
1448 "Sebastian and Tinette were now sent for to clear up the broken"
1448 "articles and put things in order again; the tutor said good-"
1448 "morning and left, as it was impossible to do any more lessons"
1448 "that day; there had been certainly no time for gaping this"
1448 "morning."
1448 ""
1448 "Clara had to rest for a certain time during the afternoon, and"
1448 "during this interval, as Fraulein Rottenmeier informed Heidi,"
1448 "the latter might amuse herself as she liked. When Clara had been"
1448 "placed on her couch after dinner, and the lady-housekeeper had"
1448 "retired to her room, Heidi knew that her time had come to choose"
1448 "her own occupation. It was just what she was longing for, as"
1448 "there was something she had made up her mind to do; but she"
1448 "would require some help for its accomplishment, and in view of"
1448 "this she took her stand in the hall in front of the dining-room"
1448 "door in order to intercept the person she wanted. In a few"
1448 "minutes up came Sebastian from the kitchen with a tray of silver"
1448 "tea-things, which he had to put away in the dining-room cupboard."
1448 "As he reached the top stairs Heidi went up to him and addressed"
1448 "him in the formal manner she had been ordered to use by Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier."
1448 ""
1448 "Sebastian looked surprised and said somewhat curtly, \"What is it"
1448 "you want, miss?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I only wished to ask you something, but it is nothing bad like"
1448 "this morning,\" said Heidi, anxious to conciliate him, for she"
1448 "saw that Sebastian was rather in a cross temper, and quite"
1448 "thought that it was on account of the ink she had spilt on the"
1448 "floor."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Indeed, and why, I should first like to know, do you address me"
1448 "like that?\" replied Sebastian, evidently still put out."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Fraulein Rottenmeier told me always to speak to you like that,\""
1448 "said Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "Then Sebastian laughed, which very much astonished Heidi, who"
1448 "had seen nothing amusing in the conversation, but Sebastian, now"
1448 "he understood that the child was only obeying orders, added in a"
1448 "friendly voice, \"What is it then that miss wants?\""
1448 ""
1448 "It was now Heidi's turn to be a little put out, and she said,"
1448 "\"My name is not miss, it is Heidi.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Quite so, but the same lady has ordered me to call you miss,\""
1448 "explained Sebastian."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Has she? oh, then I must be called so,\" said Heidi"
1448 "submissively, for she had already noticed that whatever Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier said was law. \"Then now I have three names,\" she"
1448 "added with a sigh."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What was it little miss wished to ask?\" said Sebastian as he"
1448 "went on into the dining-room to put away his silver."
1448 ""
1448 "\"How can a window be opened?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why, like that!\" and Sebastian flung up one of the large"
1448 "windows."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi ran to it, but she was not tall enough to see out, for her"
1448 "head only reached the sill."
1448 ""
1448 "\"There, now miss can look out and see what is going on below,\""
1448 "said Sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand"
1448 "on."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi climbed up, and at last, as she thought, was going to see"
1448 "what she had been longing for. But she drew back her head with a"
1448 "look of great disappointment on her face."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why, there is nothing outside but the stony streets,\" she said"
1448 "mournfully; \"but if I went right round to the other side of the"
1448 "house what should I see there, Sebastian?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Nothing but what you see here,\" he told her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Then where can I go to see right away over the whole valley?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You would have to climb to the top of a high tower, a church"
1448 "tower, like that one over there with the gold ball above it."
1448 "From there you can see right away ever so far.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi climbed down quickly from her stool, ran to the door, down"
1448 "the steps and out into the street. Things were not, however,"
1448 "quite so easy as she thought. Looking from the window the tower"
1448 "had appeared so close that she imagined she had only to run over"
1448 "the road to reach it. But now, although she ran along the whole"
1448 "length of the street, she still did not get any nearer to it,"
1448 "and indeed soon lost sight of it altogether; she turned down"
1448 "another street, and went on and on, but still no tower. She"
1448 "passed a great many people, but they all seemed in such a hurry"
1448 "that Heidi thought they had not time to tell her which way to go."
1448 "Then suddenly at one of the street corners she saw a boy"
1448 "standing, carrying a hand-organ on his back and a funny-looking"
1448 "animal on his arm. Heidi ran up to him and said, \"Where is the"
1448 "tower with the gold ball on the top?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I don't know,\" was the answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Who can I ask to show me?\" she asked again."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I don't know.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you know any other church with a high tower?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, I know one.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Come then and show it me.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Show me first what you will give me for it,\" and the boy held"
1448 "out his hand as he spoke. Heidi searched about in her pockets"
1448 "and presently drew out a card on which was painted a garland of"
1448 "beautiful red roses; she looked at it first for a moment or two,"
1448 "for she felt rather sorry to part with it; Clara had only that"
1448 "morning made her a present of it--but then, to look down into"
1448 "the valley and see all the lovely green slopes! \"There,\" said"
1448 "Heidi, holding out the card, \"would you like to have that?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The boy drew back his hand and shook his head."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What would you like then?\" asked Heidi, not sorry to put the"
1448 "card back in her pocket."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Money.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I have none, but Clara has; I am sure she will give me some;"
1448 "how much do you want?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Twopence.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Come along then.\""
1448 ""
1448 "They started off together along the street, and on the way Heidi"
1448 "asked her companion what he was carrying on his back; it was a"
1448 "hand-organ, he told her, which played beautiful music when he"
1448 "turned the handle. All at once they found themselves in front of"
1448 "an old church with a high tower; the boy stood still, and said,"
1448 "\"There it is.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"But how shall I get inside?\" asked Heidi, looking at the fast"
1448 "closed doors."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I don't know,\" was the answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you think that I can ring as they do for Sebastian?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I don't know.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi had by this time caught sight of a bell in the wall which"
1448 "she now pulled with all her might. \"If I go up you must stay"
1448 "down here, for I do not know the way back, and you will have to"
1448 "show me.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"What will you give me then for that?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"What do you want me to give you?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Another twopence.\""
1448 ""
1448 "They heard the key turning inside, and then some one pulled open"
1448 "the heavy creaking door; an old man came out and at first looked"
1448 "with surprise and then in anger at the children, as he began"
1448 "scolding them: \"What do you mean by ringing me down like this?"
1448 "Can't you read what is written over the bell, 'For those who"
1448 "wish to go up the tower'?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The boy said nothing but pointed his finger at Heidi. The latter"
1448 "answered, \"But I do want to go up the tower.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"What do you want up there?\" said the old man. \"Has somebody"
1448 "sent you?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No,\" replied Heidi, \"I only wanted to go up that I might look"
1448 "down.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Get along home with you and don't try this trick on me again,"
1448 "or you may not come off so easily a second time,\" and with that"
1448 "he turned and was about to shut the door. But Heidi took hold of"
1448 "his coat and said beseechingly, \"Let me go up, just once.\""
1448 ""
1448 "He looked around, and his mood changed as he saw her pleading"
1448 "eyes; he took hold of her hand and said kindly, \"Well, if you"
1448 "really wish it so much, I will take you.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The boy sat down on the church steps to show that he was content"
1448 "to wait where he was."
1448 ""
1448 "Hand in hand with the old man Heidi went up the many steps of"
1448 "the tower; they became smaller and smaller as they neared the"
1448 "top, and at last came one very narrow one, and there they were at"
1448 "the end of their climb. The old man lifted Heidi up that she"
1448 "might look out of the open window."
1448 ""
1448 "\"There, now you can look down,\" he said."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi saw beneath her a sea of roofs, towers, and chimney-pots;"
1448 "she quickly drew back her head and said in a sad, disappointed"
1448 "voice, \"It is not at all what I thought.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You see now, a child like you does not understand anything"
1448 "about a view! Come along down and don't go ringing at my bell"
1448 "again!\""
1448 ""
1448 "He lifted her down and went on before her down the narrow"
1448 "stairway. To the left of the turn where it grew wider stood the"
1448 "door of the tower-keeper's room, and the landing ran out beside"
1448 "it to the edge of the steep slanting roof. At the far end of"
1448 "this was a large basket, in front of which sat a big grey cat,"
1448 "that snarled as it saw them, for she wished to warn the passers-"
1448 "by that they were not to meddle with her family. Heidi stood"
1448 "still and looked at her in astonishment, for she had never seen"
1448 "such a monster cat before; there were whole armies of mice,"
1448 "however, in the old tower, so the cat had no difficulty in"
1448 "catching half a dozen for her dinner every day. The old man"
1448 "seeing Heidi so struck with admiration said, \"She will not hurt"
1448 "you while I am near; come, you can have a peep at the kittens.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions of"
1448 "delight."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, the sweet little things! the darling kittens,\" she kept on"
1448 "saying, as she jumped from side to side of the basket so as, not"
1448 "to lose any of the droll gambols of the seven or eight little"
1448 "kittens that were scrambling and rolling and falling over one"
1448 "another."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Would you like to have one?\" said the old man, who enjoyed"
1448 "watching the child's pleasure."
1448 ""
1448 "\"For myself to keep?\" said Heidi excitedly, who could hardly"
1448 "believe such happiness was to be hers."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, of course, more than one if you like--in short, you can"
1448 "take away the whole lot if you have room for them,\" for the old"
1448 "man was only too glad to think he could get rid of his kittens"
1448 "without more trouble."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi could hardly contain herself for joy. There would be"
1448 "plenty of room for them in the large house, and then how"
1448 "astonished and delighted Clara would be when she saw the sweet"
1448 "little kittens."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But how can I take them with me?\" asked Heidi, and was going"
1448 "quickly to see how many she could carry away in her hands, when"
1448 "the old cat sprang at her so fiercely that she shrank back in"
1448 "fear."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I will take them for you if you will tell me where,\" said the"
1448 "old man, stroking the cat to quiet her, for she was an old"
1448 "friend of his that had lived with him in the tower for many"
1448 "years."
1448 ""
1448 "\"To Herr Sesemann's, the big house where there is a gold dog's"
1448 "head on the door, with a ring in its mouth,\" explained Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "Such full directions as these were not really needed by the old"
1448 "man, who had had charge of the tower for many a long year and"
1448 "knew every house far and near, and moreover Sebastian was an"
1448 "acquaintance of his."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I know the house,\" he said, \"but when shall I bring them, and"
1448 "who shall I ask for?--you are not one of the family, I am sure.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, but Clara will be so delighted when I take her the"
1448 "kittens.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The old man wished now to go downstairs, but Heidi did not know"
1448 "how to tear herself away from the amusing spectacle."
1448 ""
1448 "\"If I could just take one or two away with me! one for myself"
1448 "and one for Clara, may I?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, wait a moment,\" said the man, and he drew the cat"
1448 "cautiously away into his room, and leaving her by a bowl of food"
1448 "came out again and shut the door. \"Now take two of them.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi's eyes shone with delight. She picked up a white kitten"
1448 "and another striped white and yellow, and put one in the right,"
1448 "the other in the left pocket. Then she went downstairs. The boy"
1448 "was still sitting outside on the steps, and as the old man shut"
1448 "the door of the church behind them, she said, \"Which is our way"
1448 "to Herr Sesemann's house?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I don't know,\" was the answer."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi began a description of the front door and the steps and"
1448 "the windows, but the boy only shook his head, and was not any the"
1448 "wiser."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, look here,\" continued Heidi, \"from one window you can see"
1448 "a very, very large grey house, and the roof runs like this--\""
1448 "and Heidi drew a zigzag line in the air with her forefinger."
1448 ""
1448 "With this the boy jumped up, he was evidently in the habit of"
1448 "guiding himself by similar landmarks. He ran straight off with"
1448 "Heidi after him, and in a very short time they had reached the"
1448 "door with the large dog's head for the knocker. Heidi rang the"
1448 "bell. Sebastian opened it quickly, and when he saw it was Heidi,"
1448 "\"Make haste! make haste,\" he cried in a hurried voice."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi sprang hastily in and Sebastian shut the door after her,"
1448 "leaving the boy, whom he had not noticed, standing in wonder on"
1448 "the steps."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Make haste, little miss,\" said Sebastian again; \"go straight"
1448 "into the dining-room, they are already at table; Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon. What could make the"
1448 "little miss run off like that?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi walked into the room. The lady housekeeper did not look"
1448 "up, Clara did not speak; there was an uncomfortable silence."
1448 "Sebastian pushed her chair up for her, and when she was seated"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier, with a severe countenance, sternly and"
1448 "solemnly addressed her: \"I will speak with you afterwards,"
1448 "Adelheid, only this much will I now say, that you behaved in a"
1448 "most unmannerly and reprehensible way by running out of the"
1448 "house as you did, without asking permission, without any one"
1448 "knowing a word about it; and then to go wandering about till this"
1448 "hour; I never heard of such behavior before.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Miau!\" came the answer back."
1448 ""
1448 "This was too much for the lady's temper; with raised voice she"
1448 "exclaimed, \"You dare, Adelheid, after your bad behavior, to"
1448 "answer me as if it were a joke?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I did not--\" began Heidi--\"Miau! miau!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Sebastian almost dropped his dish and rushed out of the room."
1448 ""
1448 "\"That will do,\" Fraulein Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice"
1448 "was almost stifled with anger. \"Get up and leave the room.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi stood up frightened, and again made an attempt to explain."
1448 "\"I really did not--\" \"Miau! miau! miau!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"But, Heidi,\" now put in Clara, \"when you see that it makes"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier angry, why do you keep on saying miau?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"It isn't I, it's the kittens,\" Heidi was at last given time to"

1448 ""
1448 "\"How! what! kittens!\" shrieked Fraulein Rottenmeier. \"Sebastian!"
1448 "Tinette! Find the horrid little things! take them away!\" And she"
1448 "rose and fled into the study and locked the door, so as to make"
1448 "sure that she was safe from the kittens, which to her were the"
1448 "most horrible things in creation."
1448 ""
1448 "Sebastian was obliged to wait a few minutes outside the door to"
1448 "get over his laughter before he went into the room again. He"
1448 "had, while serving Heidi, caught sight of a little kitten's head"
1448 "peeping out of her pocket, and guessing the scene that would"
1448 "follow, had been so overcome with amusement at the first miaus"
1448 "that he had hardly been able to finish handing the dishes. The"
1448 "lady's distressed cries for help had ceased before he had"
1448 "sufficiently regained his composure to go back into the dining-"
1448 "room. It was all peace and quietness there now, Clara had the"
1448 "kittens on her lap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her, both"
1448 "laughing and playing with the tiny, graceful little animals."

1448 "\"Sebastian,\" exclaimed Clara as he came in, \"you must help us;"
1448 "you must find a bed for the kittens where Fraulein Rottenmeier"

1448 "them out whenever we are alone. Where can you put them?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I will see to that,\" answered Sebastian willingly. \"I will make"
1448 "a bed in a basket and put it in some place where the lady is not"
1448 "likely to go; you leave it to me.\" He set about the work at"
1448 "once, sniggling to himself the while, for he guessed there would"
1448 "be a further rumpus about this some day, and Sebastian was not"
1448 "without a certain pleasure in the thought of Fraulein Rottenmeier"
1448 "being a little disturbed."
1448 ""
1448 "Not until some time had elapsed, and it was nearing the hour for"

1448 "a crack and call through, \"Have you taken those dreadful little"
1448 "animals away, Sebastian?\""

1448 "had sunk into a chair."

1448 "\"On some considerations I am for it, on others against it,\" he"

1448 "unfinished. The cover of the basket was loose, and at this"
1448 "moment one, two, three, and then two more, and again more kittens"
1448 "came suddenly tumbling on to the floor and racing about the room"
1448 "in every direction, and with such indescribable rapidity that it"

1448 "everything being the result of her excursion of the day before."

1448 "\"Adelaide, I know of only one punishment which will perhaps make"
1448 "you alive to your ill conduct, for you are an utter little"
1448 "barbarian, but we will see if we cannot tame you so that you"

1448 "dark cellar with the rats and black beetles.\""

1448 "known at her grandfather's as the cellar, where the fresh made"
1448 "cheeses and the new milk were kept, was a pleasant and inviting"
1448 "place; neither did she know at all what rats and black beetles"
1448 "were like."
1448 ""
1448 "But now Clara interrupted in great distress. \"No, no, Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier, you must wait till papa comes; he has written to"
1448 "say that he will soon be home, and then I will tell him"
1448 "everything, and he will say what is to be done with Heidi.\""

1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier could not do anything against this superior"

1448 "perpetually reminded by Heidi's presence of the deception that"
1448 "had been played upon her, and it seemed to her that ever since"
1448 "the child had come into the house everything had been topsy-"
1448 "turvy, and she could not bring things into proper order again."
1448 "Clara had grown much more cheerful; she no longer found time hang"
1448 "heavy during the lesson hours, for Heidi was continually making a"
1448 "diversion of some kind or other. She jumbled all her letters up"
1448 "together and seemed quite unable to learn them, and when the"
1448 "tutor tried to draw her attention to their different shapes, and"
1448 "to help her by showing her that this was like a little horn, or"
1448 "that like a bird's bill, she would suddenly exclaim in a joyful"
1448 "voice, \"That is a goat!\" \"That is a bird of prey!\" For the"
1448 "tutor's descriptions suggested all kinds of pictures to her mind,"
1448 "but left her still incapable of the alphabet. In the later"
1448 "afternoons Heidi always sat with Clara, and then she would give"
1448 "the latter many and long descriptions of the mountain and of her"
1448 "life upon it, and the burning longing to return would become so"
1448 "overpowering that she always finished with the words, \"Now I must"
1448 "go home! to-morrow I must really go!\" But Clara would try to"
1448 "quiet her, and tell Heidi that she must wait till her father"
1448 "returned, and then they would see what was to be done. And if"
1448 "Heidi gave in each time and seemed quickly to regain her good"
1448 "spirits, it was because of a secret delight she had in the"
1448 "thought that every day added two more white rolls to the number"
1448 "she was collecting for grandmother; for she always pocketed the"
1448 "roll placed beside her plate at dinner and supper, feeling that"
1448 "she could not bear to eat them, knowing that grandmother had no"
1448 "white bread and could hardly eat the black bread which was so"
1448 "hard. After dinner Heidi had to sit alone in her room for a"
1448 "couple of hours, for she understood now that she might not run"
1448 "about outside at Frankfurt as she did on the mountain, and so she"
1448 "did not attempt it. Any conversation with Sebastian in the dining-"
1448 "room was also forbidden her, and as to Tinette, she kept out of"
1448 "her way, and never thought of speaking to her, for Heidi was"
1448 "quite aware that the maid looked scornfully at her and always"
1448 "spoke to her in a mocking voice. So Heidi had plenty of time from"
1448 "day to day to sit and picture how everything at home was now"
1448 "turning green, and how the yellow flowers were shining in the"
1448 "sun, and how all around lay bright in the warm sunshine, the snow"
1448 "and the rocks, and the whole wide valley, and Heidi at times"
1448 "could hardly contain herself for the longing to be back home"
1448 "again. And Dete had told her that she could go home whenever she"
1448 "liked. So it came about one day that Heidi felt she could not"
1448 "bear it any longer, and in haste she tied all the rolls up in her"
1448 "red shawl, put on her straw hat, and went downstairs. But just as"
1448 "she reached the hall-door she met Fraulein Rottenmeier herself,"
1448 "just returning from a walk, which put a stop to Heidi's journey."
1448 ""
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier stood still a moment, looking at her from"
1448 "top to toe in blank astonishment, her eye resting particularly"
1448 "on the red bundle. Then she broke out,--"
1448 ""
1448 "\"What have you dressed yourself like that for? What do you mean"
1448 "by this? Have I not strictly forbidden you to go running about"
1448 "in the streets? And here you are ready to start off again, and"
1448 "going out looking like a beggar.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I was not going to run about, I was going home,\" said Heidi,"
1448 "frightened."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What are you talking about! Going home! You want to go home?\""
1448 "exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, her anger rising. \"To run away"
1448 "like that! What would Herr Sesemann say if he knew! Take care"
1448 "that he never hears of this! And what is the matter with his"
1448 "house, I should like to know! Have you not been better treated"
1448 "than you deserved? Have you wanted for a thing? Have you ever in"
1448 "your life before had such a house to live in, such a table, or"
1448 "so many to wait upon you? Have you?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No,\" replied Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I should think not indeed!\" continued the exasperated lady."
1448 "\"You have everything you can possibly want here, and you are an"
1448 "ungrateful little thing; it's because you are too well off and"
1448 "comfortable that you have nothing to do but think what naughty"
1448 "thing you can do next!\""

1448 "Then Heidi's feelings got the better of her, and she poured"
1448 "forth her trouble. \"Indeed I only want to go home, for if I stay"
1448 "so long away Snowflake will begin crying again, and grandmother"
1448 "is waiting for me, and Greenfinch will get beaten, because I am"
1448 "not there to give Peter any cheese, and I can never see how the"
1448 "sun says good-night to the mountains; and if the great bird were"
1448 "to fly over Frankfurt he would croak louder than ever about"
1448 "people huddling all together and teaching each other bad things,"

1448 "better.\""

1448 "\"Heaven have mercy on us, the child is out of her mind!\" cried"

1448 "\"Go and bring that unhappy little creature in at once,\" she"
1448 "ordered him, putting her hand to her forehead which she had"

1448 "much; keep up your spirits, that is the great thing! She has"
1448 "nearly made a hole in my head, but don't you let her bully you.\""
1448 "Then seeing that Heidi still did not stir, \"We must go; she"
1448 "ordered me to take you in.\""

1448 "idealistic being from another world among us.\""

1448 "\"And what could Clara do with such an idealistic being as you"
1448 "describe, Fraulein Rottenmeier.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am not joking, Herr Sesemann, the matter is a more serious"
1448 "one than you think; I have been shockingly, disgracefully imposed"
1448 "upon.\""

1448 "\"But how? what is there shocking and disgraceful? I see nothing"
1448 "shocking in the child,\" remarked Herr Sesemann quietly."
1448 ""
1448 "\"If you only knew of one thing she has done, if you only knew of"
1448 "the kind of people and animals she has brought into the house"

1448 ""
1448 "\"Animals? what am I to understand by animals, Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier?\""

1448 "\"It is past understanding; the whole behavior of the child would"
1448 "be past understanding, if it were not that at times she is"
1448 "evidently not in her right mind.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Herr Sesemann had attached very little importance to what was"
1448 "told him up till now--but not in her right mind! that was more"
1448 "serious and might be prejudicial to his own child. Herr Sesemann"
1448 "looked very narrowly at the lady opposite to assure himself that"
1448 "the mental aberration was not on her side. At that moment the"
1448 "door opened and the tutor was announced."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah! here is some one,\" exclaimed Herr Sesemann, \"who will help"

1448 "held out his hand to the tutor. \"You will drink a cup of coffee"
1448 "with me--no ceremony, I pray! And now tell me, what is the"
1448 "matter with this child that has come to be a companion to my"
1448 "daughter? What is this strange thing I hear about her bringing"
1448 "animals into the house, and is she in her right senses?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The tutor felt he must begin with expressing his pleasure at"
1448 "Herr Sesemann's return, and with explaining that he had come in"
1448 "on purpose to give him welcome, but Herr Sesemann begged him to"
1448 "explain without delay the meaning of all he had heard about"
1448 "Heidi. The tutor started in his usual style. \"If I must give my"
1448 "opinion about this little girl, I should like first to state"
1448 "that, if on one side, there is a lack of development which has"
1448 "been caused by the more or less careless way in which she has"
1448 "been brought up, or rather, by the neglect of her education,"
1448 "when young, and by the solitary life she has led on the mountain,"
1448 "which is not wholly to be condemned; on the contrary, such a"
1448 "life has undoubtedly some advantages in it, if not allowed to"
1448 "overstep a certain limit of time--\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"My good friend,\" interrupted Herr Sesemann, \"you are giving"
1448 "yourself more trouble than you need. I only want to know if the"
1448 "child has caused you alarm by any animals she has brought into"
1448 "the house, and what your opinion is altogether as to her being a"
1448 "fit companion or not for my daughter?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I should not like in any way to prejudice you against her,\""
1448 "began the tutor once more; \"for if on the one hand there is a"
1448 "certain inexperience of the ways of society, owing to the"
1448 "uncivilised life she led up to the time of her removal to"
1448 "Frankfurt, on the other hand she is endowed with certain good"
1448 "qualities, and, taken on the whole--\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Excuse me, my dear sir, do not disturb yourself, but I must--I"
1448 "think my daughter will be wanting me,\" and with that Herr"
1448 "Sesemann quickly left the room and took care not to return. He"
1448 "sat himself down beside his daughter in the study, and then"
1448 "turning to Heidi, who had risen, \"Little one, will you fetch"
1448 "me,\" he began, and then paused, for he could not think what to"
1448 "ask for, but he wanted to get the child out of the room for a"
1448 "little while, \"fetch me a glass of water.\""

1448 "\"Fresh water?\" asked Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes--Yes--as fresh as you can get it,\" he answered. Heidi"
1448 "disappeared on the spot."

1448 "\"And now, my dear little Clara,\" he said, drawing his chair"
1448 "nearer and laying her hand in his, \"answer my questions clearly"

1448 "that she is not always in her right mind?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Clara had no difficulty in answering. The alarmed lady had"
1448 "spoken to her also about Heidi's wild manner of talking, but"
1448 "Clara had not been able to put a meaning to it. She told her"
1448 "father everything about the tortoise and the kittens, and"
1448 "explained to him what Heidi had said the day Fraulein Rottenmeier"
1448 "had been put in such a fright. Herr Sesemann laughed heartily at"
1448 "her recital. \"So you do not want me to send the child home"
1448 "again,\" he asked, \"you are not tired of having her here?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, no, no,\" Clara exclaimed, \"please do not send her away."
1448 "Time has passed much more quickly since Heidi was here, for"
1448 "something fresh happens every day, and it used to be so dull, and"
1448 "she has always so much to tell me.\""

1448 "\"Yes I did; it is quite fresh. I had to go a long way, for there"
1448 "were such a lot of people at the first pump; so I went further"
1448 "down the street, but there were just as many at the second pump,"
1448 "but I was able to get some water at the one in the next street,"
1448 "and the gentleman with the white hair asked me to give his kind"
1448 "regards to Herr Sesemann.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You have had quite a successful expedition,\" said Herr Sesemann"
1448 "laughing, \"and who was the gentleman?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"He was passing, and when he saw me he stood still and said, 'As"
1448 "you have a glass will you give me a drink; to whom are you"
1448 "taking the water?' and when I said, 'To Herr Sesemann,' he"
1448 "laughed very much, and then he gave me that message for you, and"
1448 "also said he hoped you would enjoy the water.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, and who was it, I wonder, who sent me such good wishes--"
1448 "tell me what he was like,\" said Herr Sesemann."

1448 "\"It's the doctor--my old friend the doctor,\" exclaimed Clara and"

1448 "been of this new way of satisfying his thirst for water."
1448 ""
1448 "That evening when Herr Sesemann and Fraulein Rottenmeier were"
1448 "alone, settling the household affairs, he informed her that he"

1448 "desire, therefore,\" he continued, laying stress upon his words,"
1448 "\"that the child shall be in every way kindly treated, and that"
1448 "her peculiarities shall not be looked upon as crimes. If you"

1448 "prospect of her grandmother's arrival, which was to take place"
1448 "in a few days' time. Herr Sesemann had indeed only just gone when"
1448 "a letter came from Frau Sesemann, announcing her arrival on the"
1448 "following day, and stating the hour when she might be expected,"
1448 "in order that a carriage should be sent to meet her at the"

1448 "\"grandmamma,\" which brought down on her a look of displeasure"
1448 "from Fraulein Rottenmeier; this, however, had no particular"
1448 "effect on Heidi, for she was accustomed now to being continually"
1448 "in that lady's black books. But as she was going to her room"
1448 "that night, Fraulein Rottenmeier waylaid her, and drawing her"
1448 "into her own, gave her strict injunctions as to how she was to"
1448 "address Frau Sesemann when she arrived; on no account was she to"
1448 "call her \"grandmamma,\" but always to say \"madam\" to her. \"Do you"
1448 "understand?\" said the lady, as she saw a perplexed expression on"
1448 "Heidi's face. The latter had not understood, but seeing the"

1448 "the following evening, and it was easy to see that the lady who"

1448 "whom everybody had a great respect. Tinette had a new white cap"
1448 "on her head, and Sebastian collected all the footstools he could"

1448 "And now the carriage came driving up to the door, and Tinette"

1448 "had been sent up to her room and ordered to remain there until"
1448 "called down, as the grandmother would certainly like to see"
1448 "Clara alone first. Heidi sat herself down in a corner and"

1448 "Heidi had not dared to ask Fraulein Rottenmeier again how she"
1448 "was to address the grandmother: she thought the lady had perhaps"

1448 "with steady, serious eyes, for there was something kind and warm-"
1448 "hearted about this new-comer that pleased Heidi, and indeed"
1448 "everything to do with the grandmother attracted her, so that she"
1448 "could not turn her eyes away. She had such beautiful white hair,"
1448 "and two long lace ends hung down from the cap on her head and"
1448 "waved gently about her face every time she moved, as if a soft"
1448 "breeze were blowing round her, which gave Heidi a peculiar"
1448 "feeling of pleasure."

1448 "\"I am always called Heidi; but as I am now to be called"

1448 "the heart is heavy with grief to be able at any moment to go and"
1448 "tell everything to God, and pray Him for the help that no one"
1448 "else can give us. And He can help us and give us everything that"

1448 "Heidi drew her hand away, which the grandmother was holding"
1448 "affectionately between her own, and said quickly, \"May I go?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, of course,\" was the answer, and Heidi ran out of the room"
1448 "into her own, and sitting herself on a stool, folded her hands"
1448 "together and told God about everything that was making her so"
1448 "sad and unhappy, and begged Him earnestly to help her and to let"

1448 "It was about a week after this that the tutor asked Frau"
1448 "Sesemann's permission for an interview with her, as he wished to"

1448 "he spoke again. \"It is indeed truly marvellous, not only because"
1448 "she never seemed able to learn her A B C even after all my full"
1448 "explanations, and after spending unusual pains upon her, but"
1448 "because now she has learnt it so rapidly, just after I had made"
1448 "up my mind to make no further attempts at the impossible but to"
1448 "put the letters as they were before her without any dissertation"
1448 "on their origin and meaning, and now she has as you might say"
1448 "learnt her letters over night, and started at once to read"
1448 "correctly, quite unlike most beginners. And it is almost as"
1448 "astonishing to me that you should have guessed such an unlikely"
1448 "thing.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Many unlikely things happen in life,\" said Frau Sesemann with a"
1448 "pleased smile. \"Two things coming together may produce a happy"

1448 "her future progress.\""

1448 "After parting with the tutor she went down to the study to make"
1448 "sure of the good news. There sure enough was Heidi, sitting"

1448 "much surprised, and growing more and more delighted with the new"

1448 "lying on her plate when she took her place at table, and when"
1448 "she looked questioningly at the grandmother, the latter nodded"

1448 "her book before going to bed, and from that day forth her chief"
1448 "pleasure was to read the tales which belonged to the beautiful"
1448 "pictures over and over again. If the grandmother said, as they"
1448 "were sitting together in the evening, \"Now Heidi will read aloud"
1448 "to us,\" Heidi was delighted, for reading was no trouble to her"
1448 "now, and when she read the tales aloud the scenes seemed to grow"
1448 "more beautiful and distinct, and then grandmother would explain"
1448 "and tell her more about them still."

1448 "Still the picture she liked best was the one of the shepherd"
1448 "leaning on his staff with his flock around him in the midst of"
1448 "the green pasture,  for he was now at home and happy, following"
1448 "his father's sheep and goats. Then came the picture where he was"
1448 "seen far away from his father's house, obliged to look after the"
1448 "swine, and he had grown pale and thin from the husks which were"
1448 "all he had to eat. Even the sun seemed here to be less bright"
1448 "and everything looked grey and misty. But there was the third"
1448 "picture still to this tale: here was the old father with"
1448 "outstretched arms running to meet and embrace his returning and"
1448 "repentant son, who was advancing timidly, worn out and emaciated"
1448 "and clad in a ragged coat. That was Heidi's favorite tale, which"
1448 "she read over and over again, aloud and to herself, and she was"
1448 "never tired of hearing the grandmother explain it to her and"
1448 "Clara. But there were other tales in the book besides, and what"

1448 "same reason, had disappeared inside her room; but five minutes"
1448 "sufficed her, and then she was up again, and Heidi was sent for"
1448 "to her room, and there she would talk to the child and employ"
1448 "and amuse her in all sorts of ways. The grandmother had a lot of"
1448 "pretty dolls, and she showed Heidi how to make dresses and"
1448 "pinafores for them, so that Heidi learnt how to sew and to make"
1448 "all sorts of beautiful clothes for the little people out of a"
1448 "wonderful collection of pieces that grandmother had by her of"
1448 "every describable and lovely color. And then grandmother liked"

1448 "dinner, and the child came with her book under her arm. The"
1448 "grandmother called her to come close, and then laying the book"

1448 "us, He does not give it, but something better still, if only we"
1448 "will continue to pray earnestly and do not run away and lose our"
1448 "trust in Him. God did not think what you have been praying for"
1448 "was good for you just now; but be sure He heard you, for He can"
1448 "hear and see every one at the same time, because He is a God and"
1448 "not a human being like you and me. And because He thought it was"
1448 "better for you not to have at once what you wanted, He said to"
1448 "Himself: Yes, Heidi shall have what she asks for, but not until"
1448 "the right time comes, so that she may be quite happy. If I do"
1448 "what she wants now, and then one day she sees that it would have"
1448 "been better for her not to have had her own way, she will cry and"
1448 "say, 'If only God had not given me what I asked for! it is not so"
1448 "good as I expected!' And while God is watching over you, and"
1448 "looking to see if you will trust Him and go on praying to Him"
1448 "every day, and turn to Him for everything you want, you run away"
1448 "and leave off saying your prayers, and forget all about Him. And"
1448 "when God no longer hears the voice of one He knew among those who"
1448 "pray to Him, He lets that person go his own way, that he may"
1448 "learn how foolish he is. And then this one gets into trouble, and"
1448 "cries, 'Save me, God, for there is none other to help me,' and"
1448 "God says, 'Why did you go from Me; I could not help you when you"
1448 "ran away.' And you would not like to grieve God, would you Heidi,"

1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier of their experience. She was quite ready to"
1448 "receive them, for she had not been able to sleep at all in the"
1448 "anxiety of waiting to hear their report. They had no sooner given"
1448 "her details of the night's experience than she sat down and wrote"
1448 "straight off to Herr Sesemann, who had never received such a"
1448 "letter before in his life. She could hardly write, she told him,"
1448 "for her fingers were stiff with fear, and Herr Sesemann must"
1448 "please arrange to come back at once, for dreadful and"
1448 "unaccountable things were taking place at home. Then she entered"
1448 "into particulars of all that had happened, of how the door was"
1448 "found standing open every morning, and how nobody in the house"
1448 "now felt sure of their life in this unprotected state of things,"
1448 "and how it was impossible to tell what terrible results might"
1448 "follow on these mysterious doings."
1448 ""
1448 "Herr Sesemann answered that it was quite impossible for him to"
1448 "arrange to leave his business and return home at once. He was"
1448 "very much astonished at this ghost tale, but hoped by this time"
1448 "the ghost had disappeared. If, however, it still continued to"
1448 "disturb the household, would Fraulein Rottenmeier write to the"
1448 "grandmother and ask her if she could come and do something; she,"
1448 "he was sure, would soon find out a way to deal with the ghost so"
1448 "that it would not venture again to haunt his house. Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier was not pleased with the tone of this letter; she"
1448 "did not think the matter was treated seriously enough. She wrote"
1448 "off without delay to Frau Sesemann, but got no more satisfactory"
1448 "reply from that quarter, and some remarks in the letter she"
1448 "considered were quite offensive. Frau Sesemann wrote that she"
1448 "did not feel inclined to take the journey again from Holstein to"
1448 "Frankfurt because Rottenmeier fancied she saw ghosts. There had"
1448 "never been a ghost in the house since she had known it, and if"
1448 "there was one now it must be a live one, with which Rottenmeier"
1448 "ought to be able to deal; if not she had better send for the"
1448 "watchman to help her."
1448 ""
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier, however, was determined not to pass any"
1448 "more days in a state of fear, and she knew the right course to"
1448 "pursue. She had as yet said nothing to the children of the"
1448 "ghostly apparitions, for she knew if she did that the children"
1448 "would not remain alone for a single moment, and that might"
1448 "entail discomfort for herself. But now she walked straight off"
1448 "into the study, and there in a low mysterious voice told the two"
1448 "children everything that had taken place. Clara immediately"
1448 "screamed out that she could not remain another minute alone, her"
1448 "father must come home, and Fraulein Rottenmeier must sleep in her"
1448 "room at night, and Heidi too must not be left by herself, for the"
1448 "ghost might do something to her. She insisted that they should"
1448 "all sleep together in one room and keep a light burning all"
1448 "night, and Tinette had better be in the next room, and Sebastian"
1448 "and John come upstairs and spend the night in the hall, so that"
1448 "they might call out and frighten the ghost the instant they saw"
1448 "it appear on the steps. Clara, in short, grew very excited, and"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier had great difficulty in quieting her. She"
1448 "promised to write at once to her father, and to have her bed put"
1448 "in her room and not to be left alone for a moment. They could"
1448 "not all sleep in the same room, but if Heidi was frightened, why"
1448 "Tinette must go into her room. But Heidi was far more frightened"
1448 "of Tinette than of ghosts, of which the child had never before"
1448 "heard, so she assured the others she did not mind the ghost, and"
1448 "would rather be alone at night."
1448 ""
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier now sat down to write another letter to"
1448 "Herr Sesemann, stating that these unaccountable things that were"
1448 "going on in the house had so affected his daughter's delicate"
1448 "constitution that the worst consequences might be expected."
1448 "Epileptic fits and St. Vitus's dance often came on suddenly in"
1448 "cases like this, and Clara was liable to be attacked by either"
1448 "if the cause of the general alarm was not removed."
1448 ""
1448 "The letter was successful, and two days later Herr Sesemann"
1448 "stood at his front door and rang the bell in such a manner that"
1448 "everybody came rushing from all parts of the house and stood"
1448 "looking affrighted at everybody else, convinced that the ghost"
1448 "was impudently beginning its evil tricks in daylight. Sebastian"
1448 "peeped cautiously through a half-closed shutter; as he did so"
1448 "there came another violent ring at the bell, which it was"
1448 "impossible to mistake for anything but a very hard pull from a"
1448 "non-ghostly hand. And Sebastian recognised whose hand it was,"
1448 "and rushing pell-mell out of the room, fell heels over head"
1448 "downstairs, but picked himself up at the bottom and flung open"
1448 "the street door. Herr Sesemann greeted him abruptly and went up"
1448 "without a moment's delay into his daughter's room. Clara greeted"
1448 "him with a cry of joy, and seeing her so lively and apparently"
1448 "as well as ever, his face cleared, and the frown of anxiety"
1448 "passed gradually away from it as he heard from his daughter's own"
1448 "lips that she had nothing the matter with her, and moreover was"
1448 "so delighted to see him that she was quite glad about the ghost,"
1448 "as it was the cause of bringing him home again."
1448 ""
1448 "\"And how is the ghost getting on?\" he asked, turning to Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier, with a twinkle of amusement in his eye."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It is no joke, I assure you,\" replied that lady. \"You will not"
1448 "laugh yourself to-morrow morning, Herr Sesemann; what is going"
1448 "on in the house points to some terrible thing that has taken"
1448 "place in the past and been concealed.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, I know nothing about that,\" said the master of the house,"
1448 "\"but I must beg you not to bring suspicion on my worthy"

1448 "room, as I wish to speak to him alone.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Herr Sesemann had been quite aware that Sebastian and Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier were not on the best of terms, and he had his ideas"
1448 "about this scare."

1448 "\"Come here, lad,\" he said as Sebastian appeared, \"and tell me"
1448 "frankly--have you been playing at ghosts to amuse yourself at"
1448 "Fraulein Rottenmeier's expense?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, on my honor, sir; pray, do not think it; I am very"
1448 "uncomfortable about the matter myself,\" answered Sebastian with"
1448 "unmistakable truthfulness."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, if that is so, I will show you and John to-morrow morning"
1448 "how ghosts look in the daylight. You ought to be ashamed of"
1448 "yourself, Sebastian, a great strong lad like you, to run away"
1448 "from a ghost! But now go and take a message to my old friend the"
1448 "doctor; give him my kind regards, and ask him if he will come to"
1448 "me to-night at nine o'clock without fail; I have come by express"
1448 "from Paris to consult him. I shall want him to spend the night"
1448 "here, so bad a case is it; so he will arrange accordingly. You"
1448 "understand?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, sir,\" replied Sebastian, \"I will see to the matter as you"
1448 "wish.\" Then Herr Sesemann returned to Clara, and begged her to"
1448 "have no more fear, as he would soon find out all about the ghost"
1448 "and put an end to it."
1448 ""
1448 "Punctually at nine o'clock, after the children had gone to bed"
1448 "and Fraulein Rottenmeier had retired, the doctor arrived. He was"
1448 "a grey-haired man with a fresh face, and two bright, kindly"
1448 "eyes. He looked anxious as he walked in, but, on catching sight"
1448 "of his patient, burst out laughing and clapped him on the"
1448 "shoulder. \"Well,\" he said, \"you look pretty bad for a person that"
1448 "I am to sit up with all night.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Patience, friend,\" answered Herr Sesemann, \"the one you have to"
1448 "sit up for will look a good deal worse when we have once caught"
1448 "him.\""

1448 "\"Much worse than that, doctor! a ghost in the house! My house is"
1448 "haunted!\""
1448 ""
1448 "The doctor laughed aloud."
1448 ""
1448 "\"That's a nice way of showing sympathy, doctor!\" continued Herr,"
1448 "Sesemann. \"It's a pity my friend Rottenmeier cannot hear you."
1448 "She is firmly convinced that some old member of the family is"
1448 "wandering about the house doing penance for some awful crime he"
1448 "committed.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"How did she become acquainted with him?\" asked the doctor,"
1448 "still very much amused."
1448 ""
1448 "So Herr Sesemann recounted to him how the front door was nightly"
1448 "opened by somebody, according to the testimony of the combined"
1448 "household, and he had therefore provided two loaded revolvers,"
1448 "so as to be prepared for anything that happened; for either the"
1448 "whole thing was a joke got up by some friend of the servants,"
1448 "just to alarm the household while he was away--and in that case"
1448 "a pistol fired into the air would procure him a wholesome fright--"
1448 "or else it was a thief, who, by leading everybody at first to"
1448 "think there was a ghost, made it safe for himself when he came"
1448 "later to steal, as no one would venture to run out if they heard"
1448 "him, and in that case too a good weapon would not be amiss."
1448 ""
1448 "The two took up their quarters for the night in the same room in"
1448 "which Sebastian and John had kept watch. A bottle of wine was"
1448 "placed on the table, for a little refreshment would be welcome"
1448 "from time to time if the night was to be passed sitting up."
1448 "Beside it lay the two revolvers, and two good-sized candles had"
1448 "also been lighted, for Herr Sesemann was determined not to wait"
1448 "for ghosts in any half light."
1448 ""
1448 "The door was shut close to prevent the light being seen in the"
1448 "hall outside, which might frighten away the ghost. And now the"
1448 "two gentlemen sat comfortably back in the arm-chairs and began"
1448 "talking of all sorts of things, now and then pausing to take a"
1448 "good draught of wine, and so twelve o'clock struck before they"
1448 "were aware."
1448 ""
1448 "\"The ghost has got scent of us and is keeping away to-night,\""
1448 "said the doctor."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Wait a bit, it does not generally appear before one o'clock,\""
1448 "answered his friend."
1448 ""
1448 "They started talking again. One o'clock struck. There was not a"
1448 "sound about the house, nor in the street outside. Suddenly the"

1448 "\"Hush! Sesemann, don't you hear something?\""

1448 "\"You are not afraid, are you?\" said the doctor as he stood up."

1448 "\"It is better to take precautions,\" whispered Herr Sesemann, and"
1448 "seizing one of the lights in his other hand, he followed the"
1448 "doctor, who, armed in like manner with a light and a revolver,"
1448 "went softly on in front. They stepped into the hall. The"
1448 "moonlight was shining in through the open door and fell on a"
1448 "white figure standing motionless in the doorway."

1448 "\"Who is there?\" thundered the doctor in a voice that echoed"
1448 "through the hall, as the two men advanced with lights and"
1448 "weapons towards the figure."

1448 "It turned and gave a low cry. There in her little white"
1448 "nightgown stood Heidi, with bare feet, staring with wild eyes at"
1448 "the lights and the revolvers, and trembling from head to foot"
1448 "like a leaf in the wind. The two men looked as one another in"
1448 "surprise."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why, I believe it is your little water-carrier, Sesemann,\" said"
1448 "the doctor."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Child, what does this mean?\" said Herr Sesemann. \"What did you"
1448 "want? why did you come down here?\""
1448 ""
1448 "White with terror, and hardly able to make her voice heard,"
1448 "Heidi answered, \"I don't know.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But now the doctor stepped forward. \"This is a matter for me to"
1448 "see to, Sesemann; go back to your chair. I must take the child"
1448 "upstairs to her bed.\""
1448 ""
1448 "And with that he put down his revolver and gently taking the"
1448 "child by the hand led her upstairs. \"Don't be frightened,\" he"
1448 "said as they went up side by side, \"it's nothing to be"
1448 "frightened about; it's all right, only just go quietly.\""
1448 ""
1448 "On reaching Heidi's room the doctor put the candle down on the"
1448 "table, and taking Heidi up in his arms laid her on the bed and"
1448 "carefully covered her over. Then he sat down beside her and"
1448 "waited until Heidi had grown quieter and no longer trembled so"
1448 "violently. He took her hand and said in a kind, soothing voice,"
1448 "\"There, now you feel better, and now tell me where you were"
1448 "wanting to go to?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I did not want to go anywhere,\" said Heidi. \"I did not know I"
1448 "went downstairs, but all at once I was there.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I see, and had you been dreaming, so that you seemed to see and"
1448 "hear something very distinctly?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, I dream every night, and always about the same things. I"
1448 "think I am back with the grandfather and I hear the sound in the"
1448 "fir trees outside, and I see the stars shining so brightly, and"
1448 "then I open the door quickly and run out, and it is all so"
1448 "beautiful! But when I wake I am still in Frankfurt.\" And Heidi"
1448 "struggled as she spoke to keep back the sobs which seemed to"
1448 "choke her."

1448 "\"And have you no pain anywhere? no pain in your head or back?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, only a feeling as if there were a great stone weighing on"
1448 "me here.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"As if you had eaten something that would not go down.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, not like that; something heavy as if I wanted to cry very"
1448 "much.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I see, and then do you have a good cry?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, no, I mustn't; Fraulein Rottenmeier forbade me to cry.\""

1448 "\"So you swallow it all down, I suppose? Are you happy here in"

1448 "\"No, no, it was beautiful, beautiful!\" Heidi could go no"
1448 "further; the remembrance of the past, the excitement she had just"
1448 "gone through, the long suppressed weeping, were too much for the"
1448 "child's strength; the tears began to fall fast, and she broke"
1448 "into violent weeping."

1448 "an extent that she is nearly a skeleton already, and soon will be"
1448 "quite one; something must be done at once. For the first"
1448 "trouble, due to her over-excited nerves, there is but one remedy,"
1448 "to send her back to her native mountain air; and for the second"
1448 "trouble there is also but one cure, and that the same. So to-"
1448 "morrow the child must start for home; there you have my"

1448 "and with no appearance of having had an encounter with a ghost."

1448 "at once and pack up all the things belonging to the Swiss child--"
1448 "for so he usually spoke of Heidi, being unaccustomed to her name--"

1448 "occurred during the past night, and explained that the doctor"
1448 "had given his verdict and pronounced Heidi to be in a very highly"
1448 "strung state, so that her nightly wanderings might gradually"
1448 "lead her farther and farther, perhaps even on to the roof, which"
1448 "of course would be very dangerous for her. And so they had"
1448 "decided to send her home at once, as he did not like to take the"
1448 "responsibility of her remaining, and Clara would see for herself"
1448 "that it was the only thing to do. Clara was very much"
1448 "distressed, and at first made all kinds of suggestions for"
1448 "keeping Heidi with her; but her father was firm, and promised"
1448 "her, if she would be reasonable and make no further fuss, that he"

1448 "the inevitable, only stipulating that the box might be brought"
1448 "into her room to be packed, so that she might add whatever she"
1448 "liked, and her father was only too pleased to let her provide a"
1448 "nice outfit for the child. Meanwhile Dete had arrived and was"
1448 "waiting in the hall, wondering what extraordinary event had come"
1448 "to pass for her to be sent for at such an unusual hour. Herr"
1448 "Sesemann informed her of the state Heidi was in, and that he"
1448 "wished her that very day to take her home. Dete was greatly"
1448 "disappointed, for she had not expected such a piece of news. She"
1448 "remembered Uncle's last words, that he never wished to set eyes"
1448 "on her again, and it seemed to her that to take back the child to"
1448 "him, after having left it with him once and then taken it away"
1448 "again, was not a safe or wise thing for her to do. So she excused"
1448 "herself to Herr Sesemann with her usual flow of words; to-day and"
1448 "to-morrow it would be quite impossible for her to take the"
1448 "journey, and there was so much to do that she doubted if she"
1448 "could get off on any of the following days. Herr Sesemann"
1448 "understood that she was unwilling to go at all, and so dismissed"
1448 "her. Then he sent for Sebastian and told him to make ready to"
1448 "start: he was to travel with the child as far as Basle that day,"
1448 "and the next day take her home. He would give him a letter to"
1448 "carry to the grandfather, which would explain everything, and he"
1448 "himself could come back by return."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But there is one thing in particular which I wish you to look"
1448 "after,\" said Herr Sesemann in conclusion, \"and be sure you"
1448 "attend to what I say. I know the people of this hotel in Basle,"
1448 "the name of which I give you on this card. They will see to"
1448 "providing rooms for the child and you. When there, go at once"
1448 "into the child's room and see that the windows are all firmly"
1448 "fastened so that they cannot be easily opened. After the child is"
1448 "in bed, lock the door of her room on the outside, for the child"
1448 "walks in her sleep and might run into danger in a strange house"
1448 "if she went wandering downstairs and tried to open the front"
1448 "door; so you understand?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh! then that was it?\" exclaimed Sebastian, for now a light was"
1448 "thrown on the ghostly visitations."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, that was it! and you are a coward, and you may tell John"
1448 "he is the same, and the whole household a pack of idiots.\" And"
1448 "with this Herr Sesemann went off to his study to write a letter"
1448 "to Alm-Uncle. Sebastian remained standing, feeling rather"
1448 "foolish."
1448 ""
1448 "\"If only I had not let that fool of a John drag me back into the"
1448 "room, and had gone after the little white figure, which I should"
1448 "do certainly if I saw it now!\" he kept on saying to himself; but"
1448 "just now every corner of the room was clearly visible in the"
1448 "daylight."
1448 ""
1448 "Meanwhile Heidi was standing expectantly dressed in her Sunday"
1448 "frock waiting to see what would happen next, for Tinette had"
1448 "only woke her up with a shake and put on her clothes without a"
1448 "word of explanation. The little uneducated child was far too much"
1448 "beneath her for Tinette to speak to."
1448 ""
1448 "Herr Sesemann went back to the dining-room with the letter;"
1448 "breakfast was now ready, and he asked, \"Where is the child?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was fetched, and as she walked up to him to say \"Good-"
1448 "morning,\" he looked inquiringly into her face and said, \"Well,"
1448 "what do you say to this, little one?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi looked at him in perplexity."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Why, you don't know anything about it, I see,\" laughed Herr"
1448 "Sesemann. \"You are going home today, going at once.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Home,\" murmured Heidi in a low voice, turning pale; she was so"
1448 "overcome that for a moment or two she could hardly breathe."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Don't you want to hear more about it?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, yes, yes!\" exclaimed Heidi, her face now rosy with delight."
1448 ""
1448 "\"All right, then,\" said Herr Sesemann as he sat down and made"
1448 "her a sign to do the same, \"but now make a good breakfast, and"
1448 "then off you go in the carriage.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But Heidi could not swallow a morsel though she tried to do what"
1448 "she was told; she was in such a state of excitement that she"
1448 "hardly knew if she was awake or dreaming, or if she would again"
1448 "open her eyes to find herself in her nightgown at the front"
1448 "door."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Tell Sebastian to take plenty of provisions with him,\" Herr"
1448 "Sesemann called out to Fraulein Rottenmeier, who just then came"
1448 "into the room; \"the child can't eat anything now, which is quite"
1448 "natural. Now run up to Clara and stay with her till the carriage"
1448 "comes round,\" he added kindly, turning to Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi had been longing for this, and ran quickly upstairs. An"
1448 "immense trunk was standing open in the middle of the room."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Come along, Heidi,\" cried Clara, as she entered; \"see all the"
1448 "things I have had put in for you--aren't you pleased?\""
1448 ""
1448 "And she ran over a list of things, dresses and aprons and"
1448 "handkerchiefs, and all kinds of working materials. \"And look"
1448 "here,\" she added, as she triumphantly held up a basket. Heidi"
1448 "peeped in and jumped for joy, for inside it were twelve"
1448 "beautiful round white rolls, all for grandmother. In their"
1448 "delight the children forgot that the time had come for them to"
1448 "separate, and when some one called out, \"The carriage is here,\""
1448 "there was no time for grieving."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book; she knew no one"
1448 "could have packed that, as it lay under her pillow, for Heidi"
1448 "had kept it by her night and day. This was put in the basket with"
1448 "the rolls. Then she opened her wardrobe to look for another"
1448 "treasure, which perhaps no one would have thought of packing--and"
1448 "she was right--the old red shawl had been left behind, Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier not considering it worth putting in with the other"
1448 "things. Heidi wrapped it round something else which she laid on"
1448 "the top of the basket, so that the red package was quite"
1448 "conspicuous. Then she put on her pretty hat and left the room."
1448 "The children could not spend much time over their farewells, for"
1448 "Herr Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage. Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier was waiting at the top of the stairs to say good-bye"
1448 "to her. When she caught sight of the strange little red bundle,"
1448 "she took it out of the basket and threw it on the ground. \"No,"
1448 "no, Adelaide,\" she exclaimed, \"you cannot leave the house with"
1448 "that thing. What can you possibly want with it!\" And then she"
1448 "said good-bye to the child. Heidi did not dare take up her"
1448 "little bundle, but she gave the master of the house an imploring"
1448 "look, as if her greatest treasure had been taken from her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, no,\" said Herr Sesemann in a very decided voice, \"the child"
1448 "shall take home with her whatever she likes, kittens and"
1448 "tortoises, if it pleases her; we need not put ourselves out"
1448 "about that, Fraulein Rottenmeier.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi quickly picked up her bundle, with a look of joy and"
1448 "gratitude. As she stood by the carriage door, Herr Sesemann gave"
1448 "her his hand and said he hoped she would remember him and Clara."
1448 "He wished her a happy journey, and Heidi thanked him for all his"
1448 "kindness, and added, \"And please say good-bye to the doctor for"
1448 "me and give him many, many thanks.\" For she had not forgotten"
1448 "that he had said to her the night before, 'It will be all right"
1448 "to-morrow,' and she rightly divined that he had helped to make"
1448 "it so for her. Heidi was now lifted into the carriage, and then"
1448 "the basket and the provisions were put in, and finally Sebastian"
1448 "took his place. Then Herr Sesemann called out once more, \"A"
1448 "pleasant journey to you,\" and the carriage rolled away."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was soon sitting in the railway carriage, holding her"
1448 "basket tightly on her lap; she would not let it out of her hands"
1448 "for a moment, for it contained the delicious rolls for"
1448 "grandmother; so she must keep it carefully, and even peep inside"
1448 "it from time to time to enjoy the sight of them. For many hours"
1448 "she sat as still as a mouse; only now was she beginning to"
1448 "realize that she was going home to the grandfather, the"
1448 "mountain, the grandmother, and Peter, and pictures of all she was"
1448 "going to see again rose one by one before her eyes; she thought"
1448 "of how everything would look at home, but this brought other"
1448 "thoughts to her mind, and all of a sudden she said anxiously,"
1448 "\"Sebastian, are you sure that grandmother on the mountain is not"
1448 "dead?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, no,\" said Sebastian, wishing to soothe her, \"we will hope"
1448 "not; she is sure to be alive still.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then Heidi fell back on her own thoughts again. Now and then she"
1448 "looked inside the basket, for the thing she looked forward to"
1448 "most was laying all the rolls out on grandmother's table. After"
1448 "a long silence she spoke again, \"If only we could know for"
1448 "certain that grandmother is alive!\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, yes,\" said Sebastian, half asleep; \"she is sure to be"
1448 "alive, there is no reason why she should be dead.\""
1448 ""
1448 "After a while sleep fell on Heidi too, and after her disturbed"
1448 "night and early rising she slept so soundly that she did not"
1448 "wake till Sebastian shook her by the arm and called to her, \"Wake"
1448 "up, wake up! we shall have to get out directly; we are just in"
1448 "Basle!\""
1448 ""
1448 "There was a further railway journey of many hours the next day."
1448 "Heidi again sat with her basket on her knee, for she would not"
1448 "have given it up to Sebastian on any consideration; to-day she"
1448 "never even opened her mouth, for her excitement, which increased"
1448 "with every mile of the journey, kept her speechless. All of a"
1448 "sudden, before Heidi expected it, a voice called out,"
1448 "\"Mayenfeld.\" She and Sebastian both jumped up, the latter also"
1448 "taken by surprise. In another minute they were both standing on"
1448 "the platform with Heidi's trunk, and the train was steaming away"
1448 "down the valley. Sebastian looked after it regretfully, for he"
1448 "preferred the easier mode of travelling to a wearisome climb on"
1448 "foot, especially as there was danger no doubt as well as fatigue"
1448 "in a country like this, where, according to Sebastian's idea,"
1448 "everything and everybody were half savage. He therefore looked"
1448 "cautiously to either side to see who was a likely person to ask"
1448 "the safest way to Dorfli."
1448 ""
1448 "Just outside the station he saw a shabby-looking little cart and"
1448 "horse which a broad-shouldered man was loading with heavy sacks"
1448 "that had been brought by the train, so he went up to him and"
1448 "asked which was the safest way to get to Dorfli."
1448 ""
1448 "\"All the roads about here are safe,\" was the curt reply."
1448 ""
1448 "So Sebastian altered his question and asked which was the best"
1448 "way to avoid falling over the precipice, and also how a box"
1448 "could be conveyed to Dorfli. The man looked at the box, weighing"
1448 "it with his eye, and then volunteered if it was not too heavy to"
1448 "take it on his own cart, as he was driving to Dorfli. After some"
1448 "little interchange of words it was finally agreed that the man"
1448 "should take both the child and the box to Dorfli, and there find"
1448 "some one who could be sent on with Heidi up the mountain."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I can go by myself, I know the way well from Dorfli,\" put in"
1448 "Heidi, who had been listening attentively to the conversation."
1448 "Sebastian was greatly relieved at not having to do any mountain"
1448 "climbing. He drew Heidi aside and gave her a thick rolled"
1448 "parcel, and a letter for her grandfather; the parcel, he told"
1448 "her, was a present from Herr Sesemann, and she must put it at the"
1448 "bottom of her basket under the rolls and be very careful not to"
1448 "lose it, as Herr Sesemann would be very vexed if she did, and"
1448 "never be the same to her again; so little miss was to think well"
1448 "of what he said."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I shall be sure not to lose it,\" said Heidi confidently, and"
1448 "she at once put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her"
1448 "basket. The trunk meanwhile had been hoisted into the cart, and"
1448 "now Sebastian lifted Heidi and her basket on to the high seat and"
1448 "shook hands with her; he then made signs to her to keep her eye"
1448 "on the basket, for the driver was standing near and Sebastian"
1448 "thought it better to be careful, especially as he knew that he"
1448 "ought himself to have seen the child safely to her journey's"
1448 "end. The driver now swung himself up beside Heidi, and the cart"
1448 "rolled away in the direction of the mountains, while Sebastian,"
1448 "glad of having no tiring and dangerous journey on foot before"
1448 "him, sat down in the station and awaited the return train."
1448 ""
1448 "The driver of the car was the miller at Dorfli and was taking"
1448 "home his sacks of flour. He had never seen Heidi, but like"
1448 "everybody in Dorfli knew all about her. He had known her"
1448 "parents, and felt sure at once that this was the child of whom he"
1448 "had heard so much. He began to wonder why she had come back, and"
1448 "as they drove along he entered into conversation with her. \"You"
1448 "are the child who lived with your grandfather, Alm-Uncle, are you"
1448 "not?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Didn't they treat you well down there that you have come back"
1448 "so soon?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, it was not that; everything in Frankfurt is as nice as it"
1448 "could be.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Then why are you running home again?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Only because Herr Sesemann gave me leave, or else I should not"
1448 "have come.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"If they were willing to let you stay, why did you not remain"
1448 "where you were better off than at home?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Because I would a thousand times rather be with grandfather on"
1448 "the mountain than anywhere else in the world.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You will think differently perhaps when you get back there,\""
1448 "grumbled the miller; and then to himself, \"It's strange of her,"
1448 "for she must know what it's like.\""
1448 ""
1448 "He began whistling and said no more, while Heidi looked around"
1448 "her and began to tremble with excitement, for she knew every"
1448 "tree along the way, and there overhead were the high jagged peaks"
1448 "of the mountain looking down on her like old friends. And Heidi"
1448 "nodded back to them, and grew every moment more wild with her"
1448 "joy and longing, feeling as if she must jump down from the cart"
1448 "and run with all her might till she reached the top. But she sat"
1448 "quite still and did not move, although inwardly in such"
1448 "agitation. The clock was striking five as they drove into"
1448 "Dorfli. A crowd of women and children immediately surrounded the"
1448 "cart, for the box and the child arriving with the miller had"
1448 "excited the curiosity of everybody in the neighborhood,"
1448 "inquisitive to know whence they came and whither they were going"
1448 "and to whom they belonged. As the miller lifted Heidi down, she"
1448 "said hastily, \"Thank you, grandfather will send for the trunk,\""
1448 "and was just going to run off, when first one and then another of"
1448 "the bystanders caught hold of her, each one having a different"
1448 "question to put to her. But Heidi pushed her way through them"
1448 "with such an expression of distress on her face that they were"
1448 "forced to let her go. \"You see,\" they said to one another, \"how"
1448 "frightened she is, and no wonder,\" and then they went on to talk"
1448 "of Alm-Uncle, how much worse he had grown that last year, never"
1448 "speaking a word and looking as if he would like to kill"
1448 "everybody he met, and if the child had anywhere else to go to she"
1448 "certainly would not run back to the old dragon's den. But here"
1448 "the miller interrupted them, saying he knew more about it than"
1448 "they did, and began telling them how a kind gentleman had brought"
1448 "her to Mayenfeld and seen her off, and had given him his fare"
1448 "without any bargaining, and extra money for himself; what was"
1448 "more, the child had assured him that she had had everything she"
1448 "wanted where she had been, and that it was her own wish to return"
1448 "to her grandfather. This information caused great surprise and"
1448 "was soon repeated all over Dorfli, and that evening there was not"
1448 "a house in the place in which the astounding news was not"
1448 "discussed, of how Heidi had of her own accord given up a"
1448 "luxurious home to return to her grandfather."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi climbed up the steep path from Dorfli as quickly as she"
1448 "could; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again to take"
1448 "breath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy, and the way"
1448 "got steeper as she drew nearer the top. One thought alone filled"
1448 "Heidi's mind, \"Would she find the grandmother sitting in her"
1448 "usual corner by the spinning-wheel, was she still alive?\" At"
1448 "last Heidi caught sight of the grandmother's house in the hollow"
1448 "of the mountain and her heart began to beat; she ran faster and"
1448 "faster and her heart beat louder and louder--and now she had"
1448 "reached the house, but she trembled so she could hardly open the"
1448 "door--and then she was standing inside, unable in her"
1448 "breathlessness to utter a sound."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, my God!\" cried a voice from the corner, \"that was how Heidi"
1448 "used to run in; if only I could have her with me once again! Who"
1448 "is there?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"It's I, I, grandmother,\" cried Heidi as she ran and flung"
1448 "herself on her knees beside the old woman, and seizing her"
1448 "hands, clung to her, unable to speak for joy. And the grandmother"
1448 "herself could not say a word for some time, so unexpected was"
1448 "this happiness; but at last she put out her hand and stroked"
1448 "Heidi's curly hair, and said, \"Yes, yes, that is her hair, and"
1448 "her voice; thank God that He has granted my prayer!\" And tears"
1448 "of joy fell from the blind eyes on to Heidi's hand. \"Is it really"
1448 "you, Heidi; have you really come back to me?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, grandmother, I am really here,\" answered Heidi in a"
1448 "reassuring voice. \"Do not cry, for I have really come back and I"
1448 "am never going away again, and I shall come every day to see"
1448 "you, and you won't have any more hard bread to eat for some days,"
1448 "for look, look!\""

1448 "twelve up on grandmother's lap."

1448 "\"Ah, child! child! what a blessing you bring with you!\" the old"
1448 "woman exclaimed, as she felt and seemed never to come to the end"
1448 "of the rolls. \"But you yourself are the greatest blessing,"
1448 "Heidi,\" and again she touched the child's hair and passed her"
1448 "hand over her hot cheeks, and said, \"Say something, child, that"
1448 "I may hear your voice.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then Heidi told her how unhappy she had been, thinking that the"
1448 "grandmother might die while she was away and would never have"
1448 "her white rolls, and that then she would never, never see her"

1448 ""
1448 "Heidi stood up, and Brigitta now could not say enough in her"
1448 "admiration of the child's dress and appearance; she walked round"

1448 "see her, and see what a pretty frock she has on; you would"
1448 "hardly know her again. And the hat with the feather in it is"
1448 "yours too, I suppose? Put it on that I may see how you look in"
1448 "it?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, I would rather not,\" replied Heidi firmly. \"You can have it"
1448 "if you like; I do not want it; I have my own still.\" And Heidi"
1448 "so saying undid her red bundle and took out her own old hat,"
1448 "which had become a little more battered still during the journey."
1448 "But this was no trouble to Heidi; she had not forgotten how her"
1448 "grandfather had called out to Dete that he never wished to see"
1448 "her and her hat and feathers again, and this was the reason she"
1448 "had so anxiously preserved her old hat, for she had never ceased"
1448 "to think about going home to her grandfather. But Brigitta told"
1448 "her not to be so foolish as to give it away; she would not think"
1448 "of taking such a beautiful hat; if Heidi did not want to wear it"
1448 "she might sell it to the schoolmaster's daughter in Dorfli and"
1448 "get a good deal of money for it. But Heidi stuck to her"
1448 "intention and hid the hat quietly in a corner behind the"
1448 "grandmother's chair. Then she took off her pretty dress and put"
1448 "her red shawl on over her under-petticoat, which left her arms"
1448 "bare; and now she clasped the old woman's hand. \"I must go home"
1448 "to grandfather,\" she said, \"but to-morrow I shall come again. Good-"
1448 "night, grandmother.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, come again, be sure you come again tomorrow,\" begged the"

1448 "\"Why have you taken off that pretty dress?\" asked Brigitta."

1448 "perhaps he would not know me; you hardly did at first.\""

1448 "Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a"
1448 "mysterious voice, \"You might have kept on your dress, he would"

1448 "tells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never"

1448 "Heidi bid her good-night and continued her way up the mountain,"
1448 "her basket on her arm. All around her the steep green slopes"
1448 "shone bright in the evening sun, and soon the great gleaming snow-"
1448 "field up above came in sight. Heidi was obliged to keep on"
1448 "pausing to look behind her, for the higher peaks were behind her"
1448 "as she climbed. Suddenly a warm red glow fell on the grass at"
1448 "her feet; she looked back again--she had not remembered how"
1448 "splendid it was, nor seen anything to compare to it in her dreams--"
1448 "for there the two high mountain peeks rose into the air like two"
1448 "great flames, the whole snow-field had turned crimson, and rosy-"
1448 "colored clouds floated in the sky above. The grass upon the"
1448 "mountain sides had turned to gold, the rocks were all aglow, and"
1448 "the whole valley was bathed in golden mist. And as Heidi stood"
1448 "gazing around her at all this splendor the tears ran down her"
1448 "cheeks for very delight and happiness, and impulsively she put"
1448 "her hands together, and lifting her eyes to heaven, thanked God"
1448 "aloud for having brought her home, thanked Him that everything"
1448 "was as beautiful as ever, more beautiful even than she had"
1448 "thought, and that it was all hers again once more. And she was so"
1448 "overflowing with joy and thankfulness that she could not find"

1448 "could she tear herself away. Then she ran on so quickly that in"
1448 "a very little while she caught sight of the tops of the fir trees"
1448 "above the hut roof, then the roof itself, and at last the whole"
1448 "hut, and there was grandfather sitting as in old days smoking"
1448 "his pipe, and she could see the fir trees waving in the wind."
1448 "Quicker and quicker went her little feet, and before Alm-Uncle"
1448 "had time to see who was coming, Heidi had rushed up to him,"
1448 "thrown down her basket and flung her arms round his neck, unable"
1448 "in the excitement of seeing him again to say more than"
1448 "\"Grandfather! grandfather! grandfather!\" over and over again."
1448 ""
1448 "And the old man himself said nothing. For the first time for"
1448 "many years his eyes were wet, and he had to pass his hand across"
1448 "them. Then he unloosed Heidi's arms, put her on his knee, and"
1448 "after looking at her for a moment, \"So you have come back to me,"
1448 "Heidi,\" he said, \"how is that? You don't look much of a grand"
1448 "lady. Did they send you away?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, no, grandfather,\" said Heidi eagerly, \"you must not think"
1448 "that; they were all so kind--Clara, and grandmamma, and Herr"
1448 "Sesemann. But you see, grandfather, I did not know how to bear"
1448 "myself till I got home again to you. I used to think I should"
1448 "die, for I felt as if I could not breathe; but I never said"
1448 "anything because it would have been ungrateful. And then"
1448 "suddenly one morning quite early Herr Sesemann said to me--but I"
1448 "think it was partly the doctor's doing--but perhaps it's all in"
1448 "the letter--\" and Heidi jumped down and fetched the roll and the"
1448 "letter and handed them both to her grandfather."
1448 ""
1448 "\"That belongs to you,\" said the latter, laying the roll down on"
1448 "the bench beside him. Then he opened the letter, read it through"
1448 "and without a word put it in his pocket."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?\" he"
1448 "asked, taking the child by the hand to go into the hut. \"But"
1448 "bring your money with you; you can buy a bed and bedclothes and"
1448 "dresses for a couple of years with it.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am sure I do not want it,\" replied Heidi. \"I have got a bed"
1448 "already, and Clara has put such a lot of clothes in my box that"
1448 "I shall never want any more.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Take it and put it in the cupboard; you will want it some day I"
1448 "have no doubt.\""

1448 "Heidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather into the"
1448 "house; she ran into all the corners, delighted to see everything"
1448 "again, and then went up the ladder--but there she came to a"
1448 "pause and called down in a tone of surprise and distress, \"Oh,"
1448 "grandfather, my bed's gone.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"We can soon make it up again,\" he answered her from below. \"I"
1448 "did not know that you were coming back; come along now and have"
1448 "your milk.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi came down, sat herself on her high stool in the old place,"
1448 "and then taking up her bowl drank her milk eagerly, as if she"
1448 "had never come across anything so delicious, and as she put down"
1448 "her bowl, she exclaimed, \"Our milk tastes nicer than anything"
1448 "else in the world, grandfather.\""
1448 ""
1448 "A shrill whistle was heard outside. Heidi darted out like a"
1448 "flash of lightning. There were the goats leaping and springing"
1448 "among the rocks, with Peter in their midst. When he caught sight"
1448 "of Heidi he stood still with astonishment and gazed speechlessly"
1448 "at her. Heidi called out, \"Good-evening, Peter,\" and then ran in"
1448 "among the goats. \"Little Swan! Little Bear! do you know me"
1448 "again?\" And the animals evidently recognized her voice at once,"
1448 "for they began rubbing their heads against her and bleating"
1448 "loudly as if for joy, and as she called the other goats by name"
1448 "one after the other, they all came scampering towards her helter-"
1448 "skelter and crowding round her. The impatient Greenfinch sprang"
1448 "into the air and over two of her companions in order to get"
1448 "nearer, and even the shy little Snowflake butted the Great Turk"
1448 "out of her way in quite a determined manner, which left him"
1448 "standing taken aback by her boldness, and lifting his beard in"
1448 "the air as much as to say, You see who I am."

1448 "Heidi was out of her mind with delight at being among all her"
1448 "old friends again; she flung her arms round the pretty little"
1448 "Snowflake, stroked the obstreperous Greenfinch, while she"
1448 "herself was thrust at from all sides by the affectionate and"
1448 "confiding goats; and so at last she got near to where Peter was"
1448 "still standing, not having yet got over his surprise."

1448 "\"Come down, Peter,\" cried Heidi, \"and say good-evening to me.\""

1448 "\"So you are back again?\" he found words to say at last, and now"
1448 "ran down and took Heidi's hand which she was holding out in"
1448 "greeting, and immediately put the same question to her which he"
1448 "had been in the habit of doing in the old days when they"
1448 "returned home in the evening, \"Will you come out with me again to-"
1448 "morrow?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Not to-morrow, but the day after perhaps, for to-morrow I must"
1448 "go down to grandmother.\""

1448 "\"I am glad you are back,\" said Peter, while his whole face"
1448 "beamed with pleasure, and then he prepared to go on with his"
1448 "goats; but he never had had so much trouble with them before, for"
1448 "when at last, by coaxing and threats, he had got them all"
1448 "together, and Heidi had gone off with an arm over either head of"
1448 "her grandfather's two, the whole flock suddenly turned and ran"
1448 "after her. Heidi had to go inside the stall with her two and shut"
1448 "the door, or Peter would never have got home that night. When"
1448 "Heidi went indoors after this she found her bed already made up"
1448 "for her; the hay had been piled high for it and smelt"
1448 "deliciously, for it had only just been got in, and the"
1448 "grandfather had carefully spread and tucked in the clean sheets."
1448 "It was with a happy heart that Heidi lay down in it that night,"
1448 "and her sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year past."
1448 "The grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and"
1448 "mounted the ladder to see if Heidi was all right and showing no"
1448 "signs of restlessness, and to feel that the hay he had stuffed"
1448 "into the round window was keeping the moon from shining too"
1448 "brightly upon her. But Heidi did not stir; she had no need now"
1448 "to wander about, for the great burning longing of her heart was"
1448 "satisfied; she had seen the high mountains and rocks alight in"
1448 "the evening glow, she had heard the wind in the fir trees, she"
1448 "was at home again on the mountain."

1448 "Heidi was standing under the waving fir trees waiting for her"

1448 "then on to Dorfli to fetch her box. She was longing to know how"
1448 "grandmother had enjoyed her white bread and impatient to see and"
1448 "hear her again; but no time seemed weary to her now, for she"
1448 "could not listen long enough to the familiar voice of the trees,"
1448 "or drink in too much of the fragrance wafted to her from the"
1448 "green pastures where the golden-headed flowers were glowing in"

1448 "Then she took hold of Heidi's hand and held it fast in her own,"
1448 "for she still seemed to fear that the child might be torn from"
1448 "her again. And now she had to tell Heidi how much she had"
1448 "enjoyed the white bread, and how much stronger she felt already"
1448 "for having been able to eat it, and then Peter's mother went on"
1448 "and said she was sure that if her mother could eat like that for"
1448 "a week she would get back some of her strength, but she was so"
1448 "afraid of coming to the end of the rolls, that she had only"
1448 "eaten one as yet. Heidi listened to all Brigitta said, and sat"
1448 "thinking for a while. Then she suddenly thought of a way."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I know, grandmother, what I will do,\" she said eagerly, \"I will"
1448 "write to Clara, and she will send me as many rolls again, if not"
1448 "twice as many as you have already, for I had ever such a large"
1448 "heap in the wardrobe, and when they were all taken away she"
1448 "promised to give me as many back, and she would do so I am"
1448 "sure.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"That is a good idea,\" said Brigitta; \"but then, they would get"
1448 "hard and stale. The baker in Dorfli makes the white rolls, and"
1448 "if we could get some of those he has over now and then--but I can"
1448 "only just manage to pay for the black bread.\""
1448 ""
1448 "A further bright thought came to Heidi, and with a look of joy,"
1448 "\"Oh, I have lots of money, grandmother,\" she cried gleefully,"
1448 "skipping about the room in her delight, \"and I know now what I"
1448 "will do with it. You must have a fresh white roll every day, and"

1448 "\"No, no, child!\" answered the grandmother, \"I cannot let you do"

1448 "grow quite strong again--and, Oh, grandmother,\" she suddenly"
1448 "exclaimed with an increase of jubilation in her voice, \"if you"

1448 "it's only because you are weak that it is dark.\" The grandmother"
1448 "said nothing, she did not wish to spoil the child's pleasure. As"

1448 "husks to eat such as the swine fed upon. And then he thought of"
1448 "his old happy life at home and of how kindly his father had"
1448 "treated him and how ungrateful he had been, and he wept for"
1448 "sorrow and longing. And he thought to himself, \"I will arise and"
1448 "go to my father, and will say to him, 'Father, I am not worthy to"
1448 "be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.'\" And"

1448 "if some great joy had come to them all. At the close of the"

1448 "congregation looked curiously after him, some even following to"
1448 "see whether he went inside the pastor's house, which he did."

1448 "what had brought the old man down, and what it all meant. Some,"
1448 "however, adopted a new tone and expressed their opinion that Alm-"
1448 "Uncle was not so bad after all as they thought, \"for see how"
1448 "carefully he took the little one by the hand.\" And others"
1448 "responded and said they had always thought people had"
1448 "exaggerated about him, that if he was so downright bad he would"
1448 "be afraid to go inside the pastor's house. Then the miller put in"
1448 "his word, \"Did I not tell you so from the first? What child is"

1448 "to see him there; he probably had caught sight of the old man in"
1448 "church. He shook hands warmly with him, and Alm-Uncle was unable"
1448 "at first to speak, for he had not expected such a friendly"
1448 "reception. At last he collected himself and said, \"I have come"
1448 "to ask you, pastor, to forget the words I spoke to you when you"

1448 "your advice and to find a place for myself at Dorfli for the"
1448 "winter, for the child is not strong enough to stand the bitter"

1448 "winter evening together, for I shall prize your companionship,"

1448 "He did not say good-bye to him till they were standing outside,"
1448 "so that all the people standing about saw him shake hands as if"
1448 "parting reluctantly from his best friend. The door had hardly"
1448 "shut behind him before the whole congregation now came forward"
1448 "to greet Alm-Uncle, every one striving to be the first to shake"
1448 "hands with him, and so many were held out that Alm-Uncle did not"
1448 "know with which to begin; and some said, \"We are so pleased to"
1448 "see you among us again,\" and another, \"I have long been wishing"
1448 "we could have a talk together again,\" and greetings of all kinds"
1448 "echoed from every side, and when Alm-Uncle told them he was"
1448 "thinking of returning to his old quarters in Dorfli for the"
1448 "winter, there was such a general chorus of pleasure that any one"
1448 "would have thought he was the most beloved person in all Dorfli,"
1448 "and that they had hardly known how to live without him. Most of"
1448 "his friends accompanied him and Heidi some way up the mountain,"
1448 "and each as they bid him good-bye made him promise that when he"
1448 "next came down he would without fail come and call. As the old"
1448 "man at last stood alone with the child, watching their"
1448 "retreating figures, there was a light upon his face as if"
1448 "reflected from some inner sunshine of heart. Heidi, looking up at"
1448 "him with her clear steady eyes, said, \"Grandfather, you look"
1448 "nicer and nicer to-day, I never saw you quite like that before.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you think so?\" he answered with a smile. \"Well, yes, Heidi,"
1448 "I am happier to-day than I deserve, happier than I had thought"
1448 "possible; it is good to be at peace with God and man! God was"
1448 "good to me when He sent you to my hut.\""
1448 ""
1448 "When they reached Peter's home the grandfather opened the door"
1448 "and walked straight in. \"Good-morning, grandmother,\" he said. \"I"

1448 "surprise. \"That I should live to see such a thing! and now I can"
1448 "thank you for all that you have done for me. May God reward you!"
1448 "may God reward you!\" She stretched out a trembling hand to him,"
1448 "and when the grandfather shook it warmly, she went on, still"
1448 "holding his, \"And I have something on my heart I want to say, a"
1448 "prayer to make to you! If I have injured you in any way, do not"
1448 "punish me by sending the child away again before I lie under the"
1448 "grass. Oh, you do not know what that child is to me!\" and she"
1448 "clasped the child to her, for Heidi had already taken her usual"
1448 "stand close to the grandmother."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Have no fear, grandmother,\" said Uncle in a reassuring voice,"
1448 "\"I shall not punish either you or myself by doing so. We are all"
1448 "together now, and pray God we may continue so for long.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Brigitta now drew the Uncle aside towards a corner of the room"
1448 "and showed him the hat with the feathers, explaining to him how"

1448 "a thing from a child."

1448 "But the grandfather looked towards Heidi without any displeasure"

1448 "Brigitta was highly delighted at this. \"It is well worth more"

1448 ""
1448 "A merry look came into the grandfather's eye. He thought it"

1448 "opportunity before starting. At this moment the subject of their"
1448 "conversation himself rushed in, evidently in a great hurry,"
1448 "knocking his head violently against the door in his haste, so"
1448 "that everything in the room rattled. Gasping and breathless he"
1448 "stood still after this and held out a letter. This was another"
1448 "great event, for such a thing had never happened before; the"
1448 "letter was addressed to Heidi and had been delivered at the post-"
1448 "office in Dorfli. They all sat down round the table to hear what"
1448 "was in it, for Heidi opened it at once and read it without"
1448 "hesitation. The letter was from Clara. The latter wrote that the"
1448 "house had been so dull since Heidi left that she did not know how"
1448 "to bear herself, and she had at last persuaded her father to take"
1448 "her to the baths at Ragatz in the coming autumn; grandmamma had"
1448 "arranged to join them there, and they both were looking forward"
1448 "to paying her and her grandfather a visit. And grandmamma sent a"
1448 "further message to Heidi which was that the latter had done quite"
1448 "right to take the rolls to the grandmother, and so that she might"
1448 "not have to eat them dry, she was sending some coffee, which was"
1448 "already on its way, and grandmamma hoped when she came to the"
1448 "Alm in the autumn that Heidi would take her to see her old"
1448 "friend."
1448 ""
1448 "There were exclamations of pleasure and astonishment on hearing"
1448 "all this news, and so much to talk and ask about that even the"
1448 "grandfather did not notice how the time was passing; there was"
1448 "general delight at the thought of the coming days, and even more"
1448 "at the meeting which had taken place on this one, and the"
1448 "grandmother spoke and said, \"The happiest of all things is when"
1448 "an old friend comes and greets us as in former times; the heart"

1448 "uncle, and you child, to-morrow?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The old man and Heidi promised her faithfully to do so; then it"
1448 "was time to break up the party, and these two went back up the"

1448 "their journey down in the morning, so now they were accompanied"
1448 "by the peaceful evening chimes as they climbed to the hut, which"

1448 "But when grandmamma comes next autumn there will be many fresh"
1448 "joys and surprises both for Heidi and grandmother; without doubt"

1448 "light and sweetness that it seemed as if everybody must rejoice."
1448 "But the doctor walked with his eyes fastened to the ground and"
1448 "did not once lift them to the blue sky above him. There was an"
1448 "expression of sadness on his face, formerly so cheerful, and his"
1448 "hair had grown greyer since the spring. The doctor had had an"
1448 "only daughter, who, after his wife's death, had been his sole"
1448 "and constant companion, but only a few months previously death"
1448 "had deprived him of his dear child, and he had never been the"
1448 "same bright and cheery man since."

1448 "kindness won the hearts of the whole household."

1448 "pleasant voice as he preceded Sebastian up the stairs."

1448 "\"I am glad you have come, doctor,\" exclaimed Herr Sesemann as"
1448 "the latter entered. \"We must really have another talk over this"
1448 "Swiss journey; do you still adhere to your decision, even though"
1448 "Clara is decidedly improving in health?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"My dear Sesemann, I never knew such a man as you!\" said the"
1448 "doctor as he sat down beside his friend. \"I really wish your"
1448 "mother was here; everything would be clear and straightforward"
1448 "then and she would soon put things in right train. You sent for"
1448 "me three times yesterday only to ask me the same question,"
1448 "though you know what I think.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, I know, it's enough to make you out of patience with me;"
1448 "but you must understand, dear friend\"--and Herr Sesemann laid"
1448 "his hand imploringly on the doctor's shoulder--\"that I feel I"
1448 "have not the courage to refuse the child what I have been"
1448 "promising her all along, and for months now she has been living"
1448 "on the thought of it day and night. She bore this last bad attack"
1448 "so patiently because she was buoyed up with the hope that she"
1448 "should soon start on her Swiss journey, and see her friend Heidi"
1448 "again; and now must I tell the poor child, who has to give up so"
1448 "many pleasures, that this visit she has so long looked forward to"
1448 "must also be cancelled? I really have not the courage to do it.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You must make up your mind to it, Sesemann,\" said the doctor"
1448 "with authority, and as his friend continued silent and dejected"
1448 "he went on after a pause, \"Consider yourself how the matter"
1448 "stands. Clara has not had such a bad summer as this last one for"
1448 "years. Only the worst results would follow from the fatigue of"
1448 "such a journey, and it is out of the question for her. And then"
1448 "we are already in September, and although it may still be warm"
1448 "and fine up there, it may just as likely be already very cold."
1448 "The days too are growing short, and as Clara cannot spend the"
1448 "night up there she would only have a two hours' visit at the"
1448 "outside. The journey from Ragatz would take hours, for she would"
1448 "have to be carried up the mountain in a chair. In short,"
1448 "Sesemann, it is impossible. But I will go in with you and talk"
1448 "to Clara; she is a reasonable child, and I will tell her what my"
1448 "plans are. Next May she shall be taken to the baths and stay"
1448 "there for the cure until it is quite hot weather. Then she can"
1448 "be carried up the mountain from time to time, and when she is"
1448 "stronger she will enjoy these excursions far more than she would"
1448 "now. Understand, Sesemann, that if we want to give the child a"
1448 "chance of recovery we must use the utmost care and"
1448 "watchfulness.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Herr Sesemann, who had listened to the doctor in sad and"

1448 "You do not come back to an empty house and sit down to a"
1448 "solitary meal. And the child is happy and comfortable at home"
1448 "too. If there is much that she has to give up, she has on the"
1448 "other hand many advantages. No, Sesemann, you are not so greatly"
1448 "to be pitied--you have still the happiness of being together."
1448 "Think of my lonely house!\""

1448 "Herr Sesemann was now striding up and down the room as was his"

1448 "the journey and go and pay Heidi a visit in our name.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The doctor was taken aback at this sudden proposal and wanted to"
1448 "make objections, but his friend gave him no time to say"
1448 "anything. He was so delighted with his idea, that he seized the"
1448 "doctor by the arm and drew him into Clara's room. The kind doctor"
1448 "was always a welcome visitor to Clara, for he generally had"
1448 "something amusing to tell her. Lately, it is true, he had been"
1448 "graver, but Clara knew the reason why and would have given much"
1448 "to see him his old lively self again. She held out her hand to"
1448 "him as he came up to her; he took a seat beside her, and her"
1448 "father also drew up his chair, and taking Clara's hand in his"
1448 "began to talk to her of the Swiss journey and how he himself had"
1448 "looked forward to it. He passed as quickly as he could over the"
1448 "main point that it was now impossible for her to undertake it,"
1448 "for he dreaded the tears that would follow; but he went on"
1448 "without pause to tell her of his new plan, and dwelt on the great"
1448 "benefit it would be to his friend if he could be persuaded to"
1448 "take this holiday."

1448 "The tears were indeed swimming in the blue eyes, although Clara"
1448 "struggled to keep them down for her father's sake, but it was a"
1448 "bitter disappointment to give up the journey, the thought of"
1448 "which had been her only joy and solace during the lonely hours"
1448 "of her long illness. She knew, however, that her father would"
1448 "never refuse her a thing unless he was certain that it would be"
1448 "harmful for her. So she swallowed her tears as well as she could"
1448 "and turned her thoughts to the one hope still left her. Taking"
1448 "the doctor's hand and stroking it, she said pleadingly,--"
1448 ""

1448 "something for the grandmother. Do pray go, dear doctor, and I"

1448 "with all her sails almost into the doctor's arms, and she had to"
1448 "pause and recover herself before she could shake hands with the"
1448 "doctor with becoming decorum. She was put out at having been"
1448 "forced to enter in so undignified a manner, but the doctor had a"
1448 "way of smoothing people's ruffled feathers, and she was soon"
1448 "listening with her usual composure while he informed her of his"
1448 "intended journey, begging her in his most conciliatory voice to"
1448 "pack up the parcels for Heidi as she alone knew how to pack. And"
1448 "then he took his leave."
1448 ""
1448 "Clara quite expected to have a long tussle with Fraulein"
1448 "Rottenmeier before she would get the latter to consent to"
1448 "sending all the things that she had collected as presents for"
1448 "Heidi. But this time she was mistaken, for Fraulein Rottenmeier"
1448 "was in a more than usually good temper. She cleared the large"
1448 "table so that all the things for Heidi could be spread out upon"
1448 "it and packed under Clara's own eyes. It was no light job, for"
1448 "the presents were of all shapes and sizes. First there was the"
1448 "little warm cloak with a hood, which had been designed by Clara"
1448 "herself, in order that Heidi during the coming winter might be"
1448 "able to go and see grandmother when she liked, and not have to"
1448 "wait till her grandfather could take her wrapped up in a sack to"
1448 "keep her from freezing. Then came a thick warm shawl for the"
1448 "grandmother, in which she could wrap herself well up and not feel"
1448 "the cold when the wind came sweeping in such terrible gusts round"
1448 "the house. The next object was the large box full of cakes; these"
1448 "were also for the grandmother, that she might have something to"
1448 "eat with her coffee besides bread. An immense sausage was the"
1448 "next article; this had been originally intended for Peter, who"
1448 "never had anything but bread and cheese, but Clara had altered"
1448 "her mind, fearing that in his delight he might eat it all up at"
1448 "once and make himself ill. So she arranged to send it to"
1448 "Brigitta, who could take some for herself and the grandmother and"
1448 "give Peter his portion out by degrees. A packet of tobacco was a"
1448 "present for grandfather, who was fond of his pipe as he sat"
1448 "resting in the evening. Finally there was a whole lot of"
1448 "mysterious little bags, and parcels, and boxes, which Clara had"
1448 "had especial pleasure in collecting, as each was to be a joyful"
1448 "surprise for Heidi as she opened it. The work came to an end at"
1448 "last, and an imposing-looking package lay on the floor ready for"
1448 "transport. Fraulein Rottenmeier looked at it with satisfaction,"
1448 "lost in the consideration of the art of packing. Clara eyed it"
1448 "too with pleasure, picturing Heidi's exclamations and jumps of"
1448 "joy and surprise when the huge parcel arrived at the hut."
1448 ""
1448 "And now Sebastian came in, and lifting the package on to his"
1448 "shoulder, carried it off to be forwarded at once to the doctor's"
1448 "house."

1448 ""
1448 "The early light of morning lay rosy red upon the mountains, and"
1448 "a fresh breeze rustled through the fir trees and set their"
1448 "ancient branches waving to and fro. The sound awoke Heidi and she"
1448 "opened her eyes. The roaring in the trees always stirred a strong"
1448 "emotion within her and seemed to drew her irresistibly to them."
1448 "So she jumped out of bed and dressed herself as quickly as she"
1448 "could, but it took her some time even then, for she was careful"
1448 "now to be always clean and tidy."
1448 ""
1448 "When she went down her ladder she found her grandfather had"
1448 "already left the hut. He was standing outside looking at the sky"
1448 "and examining the landscape as he did every morning, to see what"
1448 "sort of weather it was going to be."
1448 ""
1448 "Little pink clouds were floating over the sky, that was growing"
1448 "brighter and bluer with every minute, while the heights and the"
1448 "meadow lands were turning gold under the rising sun, which was"
1448 "just appearing above the topmost peaks."
1448 ""
1448 "\"O how beautiful! how beautiful! Good-morning, grandfather!\""
1448 "cried Heidi, running out."
1448 ""
1448 "\"What, you are awake already, are you?\" he answered, giving her"
1448 "a morning greeting."
1448 ""
1448 "Then Heidi ran round to the fir trees to enjoy the sound she"
1448 "loved so well, and with every fresh gust of wind which came"
1448 "roaring through their branches she gave a fresh jump and cry of"
1448 "delight."
1448 ""
1448 "Meanwhile the grandfather had gone to milk the goats; this done"
1448 "he brushed and washed them, ready for their mountain excursion,"
1448 "and brought them out of their shed. As soon as Heidi caught"
1448 "sight of her two friends she ran and embraced them, and they"
1448 "bleated in return, while they vied with each other in showing"
1448 "their affection by poking their heads against her and trying"
1448 "which could get nearest her, so that she was almost crushed"
1448 "between them. But Heidi was not afraid of them, and when the"
1448 "lively Little Bear gave rather too violent a thrust, she only"
1448 "said, \"No, Little Bear, you are pushing like the Great Turk,\" and"
1448 "Little Bear immediately drew back his head and left off his rough"
1448 "attentions, while Little Swan lifted her head and put on an"
1448 "expression as much as to say, \"No one shall ever accuse me of"
1448 "behaving like the Great Turk.\" For White Swan was a rather more"
1448 "distinguished person than Brown Bear."
1448 ""
1448 "And now Peter's whistle was heard and all the goats came along,"
1448 "leaping and springing, and Heidi soon found herself surrounded"
1448 "by the whole flock, pushed this way and that by their"
1448 "obstreperous greetings, but at last she managed to get through"
1448 "them to where Snowflake was standing, for the young goat had in"
1448 "vain striven to reach her."
1448 ""
1448 "Peter now gave a last tremendous whistle, in order to startle"
1448 "the goats and drive them off, for he wanted to get near himself"
1448 "to say something to Heidi. The goats sprang aside and he came up"
1448 "to her."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Can you come out with me to-day?\" he asked, evidently unwilling"
1448 "to hear her refuse."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I am afraid I cannot, Peter,\" she answered. \"I am expecting"
1448 "them every minute from Frankfurt, and I must be at home when they"
1448 "come.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"You have said the same thing for days now,\" grumbled Peter."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I must continue to say it till they come,\" replied Heidi. \"How"
1448 "can you think, Peter, that I would be away when they came? As if"
1448 "I could do such a thing?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"They would find Uncle at home,\" he answered with a snarling"
1448 "voice."
1448 ""
1448 "But at this moment the grandfather's stentorian voice was heard."
1448 "\"Why is the army not marching forward? Is it the field-marshal"
1448 "who is missing or some of the troops?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Whereupon Peter turned and went off, swinging his stick round so"
1448 "that it whistled through the air, and the goats, who understood"
1448 "the signal, started at full trot for their mountain pasture,"
1448 "Peter following in their wake."
1448 ""
1448 "Since Heidi had been back with her grandfather things came now"
1448 "and then into her mind of which she had never thought in former"
1448 "days. So now, with great exertion, she put her bed in order"
1448 "every morning, patting and stroking it till she had got it"
1448 "perfectly smooth and flat. Then she went about the room"
1448 "downstairs, put each chair back in its place, and if she found"
1448 "anything lying about she put it in the cupboard. After that she"
1448 "fetched a duster, climbed on a chair, and rubbed the table till"
1448 "it shone again. When the grandfather came in later he would look"
1448 "round well pleased and say to himself, \"We look like Sunday every"
1448 "day now; Heidi did not go abroad for nothing.\""
1448 ""
1448 "After Peter had departed and she and her grandfather had"
1448 "breakfasted, Heidi began her daily work as usual, but she did"
1448 "not get on with it very fast. It was so lovely out of doors to-"
1448 "day, and every minute something happened to interrupt her in her"
1448 "work. Now it was a bright beam of sun shining cheerfully through"
1448 "the open window, and seeming to say, \"Come out, Heidi, come out!\""
1448 "Heidi felt she could not stay indoors, and she ran out in answer"
1448 "to the call. The sunlight lay sparkling on everything around the"
1448 "hut and on all the mountains and far away along the valley, and"
1448 "the grass slope looked so golden and inviting that she was"
1448 "obliged to sit down for a few minutes and look about her. Then"
1448 "she suddenly remembered that her stool was left standing in the"
1448 "middle of the floor and that the table had not been rubbed, and"
1448 "she jumped up and ran inside again. But it was not long before"
1448 "the fir trees began their old song; Heidi felt it in all her"
1448 "limbs, and again the desire to run outside was irresistible, and"
1448 "she was off to play and leap to the tune of the waving branches."
1448 "The grandfather, who was busy in his work-shed, stepped out from"
1448 "time to time smiling to watch her at her gambols. He had just"
1448 "gone back to his work on one of these occasions when Heidi"
1448 "called out, \"Grandfather! grandfather! Come, come!\""
1448 ""
1448 "He stepped quickly out, almost afraid something had happened to"
1448 "the child, but he saw her running towards where the mountain"
1448 "path descended, crying, \"They are coming! they are coming! and"
1448 "the doctor is in front of them!\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi rushed forward to welcome her old friend, who held out his"
1448 "hands in greeting to her. When she came up to him she clung to"
1448 "his outstretched arm, and exclaimed in the joy of her heart,"
1448 "\"Good-morning, doctor, and thank you ever so many times.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"God bless you, child! what have you got to thank me for?\" asked"
1448 "the doctor, smiling."
1448 ""
1448 "\"For being at home again with grandfather,\" the child explained."
1448 ""
1448 "The doctor's face brightened as if a sudden ray of sunshine had"
1448 "passed across it; he had not expected such a reception as this."
1448 "Lost in the sense of his loneliness he had climbed the mountain"
1448 "without heeding how beautiful it was on every side, and how more"
1448 "and more beautiful it became the higher he got. He had quite"
1448 "thought that Heidi would have forgotten him; she had seen so"
1448 "little of him, and he had felt rather like one bearing a message"
1448 "of disappointment, anticipating no great show of favor, coming"
1448 "as he did without the expected friends. But instead, here was"
1448 "Heidi, her eyes dancing for joy, and full of gratitude and"
1448 "affection, clinging to the arm of her kind friend."
1448 ""
1448 "He took her by the hand with fatherly tenderness."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Take me now to your grandfather, Heidi, and show me where you"
1448 "live.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But Heidi still remained standing, looking down the path with a"
1448 "questioning gaze. \"Where are Clara and grandmother?\" she asked."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, now I have to tell you something which you will be as sorry"
1448 "about as I am,\" answered the doctor. \"You see, Heidi, I have"
1448 "come alone. Clara was very ill and could not travel, and so the"
1448 "grandmother stayed behind too. But next spring, when the days"
1448 "grow warm and long again, they are coming here for certain.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was greatly concerned; she could not at first bring"
1448 "herself to believe that what she had for so long been picturing"
1448 "to herself was not going to happen after all. She stood"
1448 "motionless for a second or two, overcome by the unexpected"
1448 "disappointment. The doctor said nothing further; all around lay"
1448 "the silence, only the sighing of the fir trees could be heard"
1448 "from where they stood. Then Heidi suddenly remembered why she had"
1448 "run down there, and that the doctor had really come. She lifted"
1448 "her eyes and saw the sad expression in his as he looked down at"
1448 "her; she had never seen him with that look on his face when she"
1448 "was in Frankfurt. It went to Heidi's heart; she could not bear to"
1448 "see anybody unhappy, especially her dear doctor. No doubt it was"
1448 "because Clara and grandmother could not come, and so she began to"
1448 "think how best she might console him."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, it won't be very long to wait for spring, and then they"
1448 "will be sure to come,\" she said in a reassuring voice. \"Time"
1448 "passes very quickly with us, and then they will be able to stay"
1448 "longer when they are here, and Clara will be pleased at that. Now"
1448 "let us go and find grandfather.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Hand in hand with her friend she climbed up to the hut. She was"
1448 "so anxious to make the doctor happy again that she began once"
1448 "more assuring him that the winter passed so quickly on the"
1448 "mountain that it was hardly to be taken account of, and that"
1448 "summer would be back again before they knew it, and she became"
1448 "so convinced of the truth of her own words that she called out"
1448 "quite cheerfully to her grandfather as they approached, \"They"
1448 "have not come to-day, but they will be here in a very short"
1448 "time.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The doctor was no stranger to the grandfather, for the child had"
1448 "talked to him so much about her friend. The old man held out his"
1448 "hand to his guest in friendly greeting. Then the two men sat"
1448 "down in front of the hut, and Heidi had her little place too, for"
1448 "the doctor beckoned her to come and sit beside him. The doctor"
1448 "told Uncle how Herr Sesemann had insisted on his taking this"
1448 "journey, and he felt himself it would do him good as he had not"
1448 "been quite the thing for a long time. Then he whispered to Heidi"
1448 "that there was something being brought up the mountain which had"
1448 "travelled with him from Frankfurt, and which would give her even"
1448 "more pleasure than seeing the old doctor. Heidi got into a great"
1448 "state of excitement on hearing this, wondering what it could be,"
1448 "The old man urged the doctor to spend as many of the beautiful"
1448 "autumn days on the mountain as he could, and at least to come up"
1448 "whenever it was fine; he could not offer him a lodging, as he had"
1448 "no place to put him; he advised the doctor, however, not to go"
1448 "back to Ragatz, but to stay at Dorfli, where there was a clean"
1448 "tidy little inn. Then the doctor could come up every morning,"
1448 "which would do him no end of good, and if he liked, he, the"
1448 "grandfather, would act as his guide to any part of the mountains"
1448 "he would like to see. The doctor was delighted with this"
1448 "proposal, and it was settled that it should be as the"
1448 "grandfather suggested."
1448 ""
1448 "Meanwhile the sun had been climbing up the sky, and it was now"
1448 "noon. The wind had sunk and the fir trees stood motionless. The"
1448 "air was still wonderfully warm and mild for that height, while a"
1448 "delicious freshness was mingled with the warmth of the sun."
1448 ""
1448 "Alm-Uncle now rose and went indoors, returning in a few minutes"
1448 "with a table which he placed in front of the seat."
1448 ""
1448 "\"There, Heidi, now run in and bring us what we want for the"
1448 "table,\" he said. \"The doctor must take us as he finds us; if the"
1448 "food is plain, he will acknowledge that the dining-room is"
1448 "pleasant.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I should think so indeed,\" replied the doctor as he looked down"
1448 "over the sun-lit valley, \"and I accept the kind invitation;"
1448 "everything must taste good up here.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi ran backwards and forwards as busy as a bee and brought"
1448 "out everything she could find in the cupboard, for she did not"
1448 "know how to be pleased enough that she could help to entertain"
1448 "the doctor. The grandfather meanwhile had been preparing the"
1448 "meal, and now appeared with a steaming jug of milk and golden-"
1448 "brown toasted cheese. Then he cut some thin slices from the meat"
1448 "he had cured himself in the pure air, and the doctor enjoyed his"
1448 "dinner better than he had for a whole year past."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Our Clara must certainly come up here,\" he said, \"it would make"
1448 "her quite a different person, and if she ate for any length of"
1448 "time as I have to-day, she would grow plumper than any one has"
1448 "ever known her before.\""
1448 ""
1448 "As he spoke a man was seen coming up the path carrying a large"
1448 "package on his back. When he reached the hut he threw it on the"
1448 "ground and drew in two or three good breaths of the mountain"
1448 "air."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, here's what travelled with me from Frankfurt,\" said the"
1448 "doctor, rising, and he went up to the package and began undoing"
1448 "it, Heidi looking on in great expectation. After he had released"
1448 "it from its heavy outer covering, \"There, child,\" he said, \"now"
1448 "you can go on unpacking your treasures yourself.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi undid her presents one by one until they were all"
1448 "displayed; she could not speak the while for wonder and delight."
1448 "Not till the doctor went up to her again and opened the large"
1448 "box to show Heidi the cakes that were for the grandmother to eat"
1448 "with her coffee, did she at last give a cry of joy, exclaiming,"
1448 "\"Now grandmother will have nice things to eat,\" and she wanted to"
1448 "pack everything up again and start at once to give them to her."
1448 "But the grandfather said he should walk down with the doctor that"
1448 "evening and she could go with them and take the things. Heidi"
1448 "now found the packet of tobacco which she ran and gave to her"
1448 "grandfather; he was so pleased with it that he immediately"
1448 "filled his pipe with some, and the two men then sat down together"
1448 "again, the smoke curling up from their pipes as they talked of"
1448 "all kinds of things, while Heidi continued to examine first one"
1448 "and then another of her presents. Suddenly she ran up to them,"
1448 "and standing in front of the doctor waited till there was a pause"
1448 "in the conversation, and then said, \"No, the other thing has not"
1448 "given me more pleasure than seeing you, doctor.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The two men could not help laughing, and the doctor answered"
1448 "that he should never have thought it."
1448 ""
1448 "As the sun began to sink behind the mountains the doctor rose,"
1448 "thinking it was time to return to Dorfli and seek for quarters."
1448 "The grandfather carried the cakes and the shawl and the large"
1448 "sausage, and the doctor took Heidi's hand, so they all three"
1448 "started down the mountain. Arrived at Peter's home Heidi bid the"
1448 "others good-bye; she was to wait at grandmother's till her"
1448 "grandfather, who was going on to Dorfli with his guest, returned"
1448 "to fetch her. As the doctor shook hands with her she asked,"
1448 "\"Would you like to come out with the goats to-morrow morning?\""
1448 "for she could think of no greater treat to offer him."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Agreed!\" answered the doctor, \"we will go together,\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi now ran in to the grandmother; she first, with some"
1448 "effort, managed to carry in the box of cakes; then she ran out"
1448 "again and brought in the sausage--for her grandfather had put the"
1448 "presents down by the door--and then a third time for the shawl."
1448 "She had placed them as close as she could to the grandmother, so"
1448 "that the latter might be able to feel them and understand what"
1448 "was there. The shawl she laid over the old woman's knees."
1448 ""
1448 "\"They are all from Frankfurt, from Clara and grandmamma,\" she"
1448 "explained to the astonished grandmother and Brigitta, the latter"
1448 "having watched her dragging in all the heavy things, unable to"
1448 "imagine what was happening."
1448 ""
1448 "\"And you are very pleased with the cakes, aren't you,"
1448 "grandmother? taste how soft they are!\" said Heidi over and over"
1448 "again, to which the grandmother continued to answer, \"Yes, yes,"
1448 "Heidi, I should think so! what kind people they must be!\" And"
1448 "then she would pass her hand over the warm thick shawl and add,"
1448 "\"This will be beautiful for the cold winter! I never thought I"
1448 "should ever have such a splendid thing as this to put on.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi could not help feeling some surprise at the grandmother"
1448 "seeming to take more pleasure in the shawl than the cakes."
1448 "Meanwhile Brigitta stood gazing at the sausage with almost an"
1448 "expression of awe. She had hardly in her life seen such a"
1448 "monster sausage, much less owned one, and she could scarcely"
1448 "believe her eyes. She shook her head and said doubtfully, \"I must"
1448 "ask Uncle what it is meant for,\""
1448 ""
1448 "But Heidi answered without hesitation, \"It is meant for eating,"
1448 "not for anything else.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter came tumbling in at this minute. \"Uncle is just behind me,"
1448 "he is coming--\" he began, and then stopped short, for his eye"
1448 "had caught sight of the sausage, and he was too much taken aback"
1448 "to say more. But Heidi understood that her grandfather was near"
1448 "and so said good-bye to grandmother. The old man now never passed"
1448 "the door without going in to wish the old woman good-day, and she"
1448 "liked to hear his footstep approaching, for he always had a"
1448 "cheery word for her. But to-day it was growing late for Heidi,"
1448 "who was always up with the lark, and the grandfather would never"
1448 "let her go to bed after hours; so this evening he only called"
1448 "good-night through the open door and started home at once with"
1448 "the child, and the two climbed under the starlit sky back to"
1448 "their peaceful dwelling."

1448 "into conversation with the boy, but his attempts failed, for he"
1448 "could hardly get a word out of Peter in answer to his questions."
1448 "Peter was not easily persuaded to talk. So the party silently"

1448 "heavier than usual, for Alm-Uncle had added some meat to-day, as"

1448 "stood still and said, \"Now you must go on in front and behave"
1448 "properly, and not keep on turning back and pushing and poking me,"
1448 "for I want to talk to the doctor,\" and she gave Snowflake a"
1448 "little pat on the back and told her to be good and obedient. By"
1448 "degrees she managed to make her way out from among them and"
1448 "joined the doctor, who took her by the hand. He had no difficulty"
1448 "now in conversing with his companion, for Heidi had a great deal"
1448 "to say about the goats and their peculiarities, and about the"
1448 "flowers and the rocks and the birds, and so they clambered on and"
1448 "reached their resting-place before they were aware. Peter had"
1448 "sent a good many unfriendly glances towards the doctor on the way"
1448 "up, which might have quite alarmed the latter if he had happened"
1448 "to notice them, which, fortunately, he did not."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi now led her friend to her favorite spot where she was"
1448 "accustomed to sit and enjoy the beauty around her; the doctor"
1448 "followed her example and took his seat beside her on the warm"
1448 "grass. Over the heights and over the far green valley hung the"
1448 "golden glory of the autumn day. The great snow-field sparkled in"
1448 "the bright sunlight, and the two grey rocky peaks rose in their"
1448 "ancient majesty against the dark blue sky. A soft, light morning"
1448 "breeze blew deliciously across the mountain, gently stirring the"
1448 "bluebells that still remained of the summer's wealth of flowers,"
1448 "their slender heads nodding cheerfully in the sunshine. Overhead"
1448 "the great bird was flying round and round in wide circles, but to-"
1448 "day he made no sound; poised on his large wings he floated"
1448 "contentedly in the blue ether. Heidi looked about her first at"
1448 "one thing and then at another. The waving flowers, the blue sky,"
1448 "the bright sunshine, the happy bird--everything was so"
1448 "beautiful! so beautiful! Her eyes were alight with joy. And now"
1448 "she turned to her friend to see if he too were enjoying the"
1448 "beauty. The doctor had been sitting thoughtfully gazing around"
1448 "him. As he met her glad bright eyes, \"Yes, Heidi,\" he responded,"
1448 "\"I see how lovely it all is, but tell me--if one brings a sad"
1448 "heart up here, how may it be healed so that it can rejoice in all"
1448 "this beauty?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, but,\" exclaimed Heidi, \"no one is sad up here, only in"
1448 "Frankfurt.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The doctor smiled and then growing serious again he continued,"
1448 "\"But supposing one is not able to leave all the sadness behind"
1448 "at Frankfurt; can you tell me anything that will help then?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"When you do not know what more to do you must go and tell"
1448 "everything to God,\" answered Heidi with decision."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Ah, that is a good thought of yours, Heidi,\" said the doctor."
1448 "\"But if it is God Himself who has sent the trouble, what can we"
1448 "say to Him then?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi sat pondering for a while; she was sure in her heart that"
1448 "God could help out of every trouble. She thought over her own"
1448 "experiences and then found her answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Then you must wait,\" she said, \"and keep on saying to yourself:"
1448 "God certainly knows of some happiness for us which He is going"
1448 "to bring out of the trouble, only we must have patience and not"
1448 "run away. And then all at once something happens and we see"
1448 "clearly ourselves that God has had some good thought in His mind"
1448 "all along; but because we cannot see things beforehand, and only"
1448 "know how dreadfully miserable we are, we think it is always going"
1448 "to be so.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"That is a beautiful faith, child, and be sure you hold it"
1448 "fast,\" replied the doctor. Then he sat on a while in silence,"
1448 "looking at the great overshadowing mountains and the green,"
1448 "sunlit valley below before he spoke again,--"
1448 ""
1448 "\"Can you understand, Heidi, that a man may sit here with such a"
1448 "shadow over his eyes that he cannot feel and enjoy the beauty"
1448 "around him, while the heart grows doubly sad knowing how"
1448 "beautiful it could be? Can you understand that?\""
1448 ""
1448 "A pain shot through the child's young happy heart. The shadow"
1448 "over the eyes brought to her remembrance the grandmother, who"
1448 "would never again be able to see the sunlight and the beauty up"
1448 "here. This was Heidi's great sorrow, which re-awoke each time"
1448 "she thought about the darkness. She did not speak for a few"
1448 "minutes, for her happiness was interrupted by this sudden pang."
1448 "Then in a grave voice she said,--"
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, I can understand it. And I know this, that then one must"
1448 "say one of grandmother's hymns, which bring the light back a"
1448 "little, and often make it so bright for her that she is quite"
1448 "happy again. Grandmother herself told me this.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Which hymns are they, Heidi?\" asked the doctor."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I only know the one about the sun and the beautiful garden, and"
1448 "some of the verses of the long one, which are favorites with"
1448 "her, and she always likes me to read them to her two or three"
1448 "times over,\" replied Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, say the verses to me then, I should like to hear them"
1448 "too,\" and the doctor sat up in order to listen better."
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi put her hands together and sat collecting her thoughts for"
1448 "a second or two: \"Shall I begin at the verse that grandmother"
1448 "says gives her a feeling of hope and confidence?\""
1448 ""
1448 "The doctor nodded his assent, and Heidi began,--"
1448 ""
1448 "    Let not your heart be troubled"
1448 "    Nor fear your soul dismay,"
1448 "    There is a wise Defender"
1448 "    And He will be your stay."
1448 "    Where you have failed, He conquers,"
1448 "    See, how the foeman flies!"
1448 "    And all your tribulation"
1448 "    Is turned to glad surprise."
1448 ""
1448 "    If for a while it seemeth"
1448 "    His mercy is withdrawn,"
1448 "    That He no longer careth"
1448 "    For His wandering child forlorn,"
1448 "    Doubt not His great compassion,"

1448 "Heidi suddenly paused; she was not sure if the doctor was still"
1448 "listening. He was sitting motionless with his hand before his"
1448 "eyes. She thought he had fallen asleep; when he awoke, if he"
1448 "wanted to hear more verses, she would go on. There was no sound"
1448 "anywhere. The doctor sat in silence, but he was certainly not"
1448 "asleep. His thoughts had carried him back to a long past time:"
1448 "he saw himself as a little boy standing by his dear mother's"
1448 "chair; she had her arm round his neck and was saying the very"
1448 "verses to him that Heidi had just recited--words which he had not"
1448 "heard now for years. He could hear his mother's voice and see her"
1448 "loving eyes resting upon him, and as Heidi ceased the old dear"
1448 "voice seemed to be saying other things to him; and the words he"
1448 "heard again must have carried him far, far away, for it was a"
1448 "long time before he stirred or took his hand from his eyes. When"
1448 "at last he roused himself he met Heidi's eyes looking wonderingly"
1448 "at him."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Heidi,\" he said, taking the child's hand in his, \"that was a"
1448 "beautiful hymn of yours,\" and there was a happier ring in his"
1448 "voice as he spoke. \"We will come out here together another day,"
1448 "and you will let me hear it again.\""

1448 "Peter meanwhile had had enough to do in giving vent to his"
1448 "anger. It was now some days since Heidi had been out with him,"
1448 "and when at last she did come, there she sat the whole time"
1448 "beside the old gentleman, and Peter could not get a word with"
1448 "her. He got into a terrible temper, and at last went and stood"
1448 "some way back behind the doctor, where the latter could not see"
1448 "him, and doubling his fist made imaginary hits at the enemy."
1448 "Presently he doubled both fists, and the longer Heidi stayed"
1448 "beside the gentleman, the more fiercely did he threaten with"

1448 "Meanwhile the sun had risen to the height which Peter knew"

1448 "Heidi was rising to fetch the dinner bag so that the doctor"
1448 "might eat his where he sat. But he stopped her, telling her he"
1448 "was not hungry at all, and only cared for a glass of milk, as he"
1448 "wanted to climb up a little higher. Then Heidi found that she"
1448 "also was not hungry and only wanted milk, and she should like,"
1448 "she said, to take the doctor up to the large moss-covered rock"
1448 "where Greenfinch had nearly jumped down and killed herself. So"

1448 "the remembrance of how he had stood with his doubled fists behind"
1448 "the doctor, who was now giving up to him his whole good dinner."
1448 "He felt as if he could not now enjoy it. But all at once he"
1448 "jumped up and ran back to the spot where he had stood before, and"
1448 "there held up his open hands as a sign that he had no longer any"

1448 "made amends for his past conduct. Then he rushed back and sat"
1448 "down to the double enjoyment of a clear conscience and an"
1448 "unusually satisfying meal."

1448 "Heidi and the doctor climbed and talked for a long while, until"
1448 "the latter said it was time for him to be going back, and no"
1448 "doubt Heidi would like to go and be with her goats. But Heidi"
1448 "would not hear of this, as then the doctor would have to go the"
1448 "whole way down the mountain alone. She insisted on accompanying"
1448 "him as far as the grandfather's hut, or even a little further."
1448 "She kept hold of her friend's hand all the time, and the whole"
1448 "way she entertained him with accounts of this thing and that,"
1448 "showing him the spots where the goats loved best to feed, and"
1448 "others where in summer the flowers of all colors grew in"
1448 "greatest abundance. She could give them all their right names,"
1448 "for her grandfather had taught her these during the summer"
1448 "months. But at last the doctor insisted on her going back; so"
1448 "they bid each other good-night and the doctor continued his"
1448 "descent, turning now and again to look back, and each time he saw"
1448 "Heidi standing on the same spot and waving her hand to him. Even"
1448 "so in the old days had his own dear little daughter watched him"
1448 "when he went from home."
1448 ""
1448 "It was a bright sunny autumn month. The doctor came up to the"
1448 "hut every morning, and thence made excursions over the mountain."
1448 "Alm-Uncle accompanied him on some of his higher ascents, when"
1448 "they climbed up to the ancient storm-beaten fir trees and often"
1448 "disturbed the great bird which rose startled from its nest, with"
1448 "the whirl of wings and croakings, very near their heads. The"
1448 "doctor found great pleasure in his companion's conversation, and"
1448 "was astonished at his knowledge of the plants that grew on the"
1448 "mountain: he knew the uses of them all, from the aromatic fir"
1448 "trees and the dark pines with their scented needles, to the"
1448 "curly moss that sprang up everywhere about the roots of the trees"
1448 "and the smallest plant and tiniest flower. He was as well versed"
1448 "also in the ways of the animals, great and small, and had many"
1448 "amusing anecdotes to tell of these dwellers in caves and holes"
1448 "and in the tops of the fir trees. And so the time passed"
1448 "pleasantly and quickly for the doctor, who seldom said good-bye"
1448 "to the old man at the end of the day without adding, \"I never"
1448 "leave you, friend, without having learnt something new from you.\""
1448 ""
1448 "On some of the very finest days, however, the doctor would"
1448 "wander out again with Heidi, and then the two would sit together"
1448 "as on the first day, and the child would repeat her hymns and"
1448 "tell the doctor things which she alone knew. Peter sat at a"
1448 "little distance from them, but he was now quite reconciled in"

1448 "September had drawn to its close, and now one morning the doctor"
1448 "appeared looking less cheerful than usual. It was his last day,"
1448 "he said, as he must return to Frankfurt, but he was grieved at"
1448 "having to say good-bye to the mountain, which he had begun to"
1448 "feel quite like home. Alm-Uncle, on his side, greatly regretted"
1448 "the departure of his guest, and Heidi had been now accustomed"

1448 "hardly believe the time had suddenly come to separate. She looked"
1448 "up at him in doubt, taken by surprise, but there was no help, he"
1448 "must go. So he bid farewell to the old man and asked that Heidi"
1448 "might go with him part of the return way, and Heidi took his hand"
1448 "and went down the mountain with him, still unable to grasp the"
1448 "idea that he was going for good. After some distance the doctor"
1448 "stood still, and passing his hand over the child's curly head"

1448 "only I could take you with me to Frankfurt and keep you there!\""

1448 "departing figure, calling out in broken tones: \"Doctor! doctor!\""

1448 ""
1448 "The snow was lying so high around the hut that the windows"
1448 "looked level with the ground, and the door had entirely"
1448 "disappeared from view. If Alm-Uncle had been up there he would"
1448 "have had to do what Peter did daily, for fresh snow fell every"
1448 "night. Peter had to get out of the window of the sitting-room"
1448 "every morning, and if the frost had not been very hard during the"
1448 "night, he immediately sank up to his shoulders almost in the snow"
1448 "and had to struggle with hands, feet, and head to extricate"
1448 "himself. Then his mother handed him the large broom, and with"
1448 "this he worked hard to make a way to the door. He had to be"
1448 "careful to dig the snow well away, or else as soon as the door"
1448 "was opened the whole soft mass would fall inside, or, if the"
1448 "frost was severe enough, it would have made such a wall of ice in"
1448 "front of the house that no one could have gone in or out, for the"
1448 "window was only big enough for Peter to creep through. The fresh"
1448 "snow froze like this in the night sometimes, and this was an"
1448 "enjoyable time for Peter, for he would get through the window on"
1448 "to the hard, smooth, frozen ground, and his mother would hand him"
1448 "out the little sleigh, and he could then make his descent to"
1448 "Dorfli along any route he chose, for the whole mountain was"
1448 "nothing but one wide, unbroken sleigh road."
1448 ""
1448 "Alm-Uncle had kept his word and was not spending the winter in"
1448 "his old home. As soon as the first snow began to fall, he had"
1448 "shut up the hut and the outside buildings and gone down to"
1448 "Dorfli with Heidi and the goats. Near the church was a straggling"
1448 "half-ruined building, which had once been the house of a person"
1448 "of consequence. A distinguished soldier had lived there at one"
1448 "time; he had taken service in Spain and had there performed many"
1448 "brave deeds and gathered much treasure. When he returned home to"
1448 "Dorfli he spent part of his booty in building a fine house, with"
1448 "the intention of living in it. But he had been too long"
1448 "accustomed to the noise and bustle of arms and the world to care"
1448 "for a quiet country life, and he soon went off again, and this"
1448 "time did not return. When after many long years it seemed"
1448 "certain that he was dead, a distant relative took possession of"
1448 "the house, but it had already fallen into disrepair, and he had"
1448 "no wish to rebuild it. So it was let to poor people, who paid but"
1448 "a small rent, and when any part of the building fell it was"
1448 "allowed to remain. This had now gone on for many years. As long"
1448 "ago as when his son Tobias was a child Alm-Uncle had rented the"
1448 "tumble- down old place. Since then it had stood empty, for no one"
1448 "could stay in it who had not some idea of how to stop up the"
1448 "holes and gaps and make it habitable. Otherwise the wind and rain"
1448 "and snow blew into the rooms, so that it was impossible even to"
1448 "keep a candle alight, and the indwellers would have been frozen"
1448 "to death during the long cold winters. Alm-Uncle, however, knew"
1448 "how to mend matters. As soon as he made up his mind to spend the"
1448 "winter in Dorfli, he rented the old place and worked during the"
1448 "autumn to get it sound and tight. In the middle of October he and"
1448 "Heidi took up their residence there."
1448 ""
1448 "On approaching the house from the back one came first into an"
1448 "open space with a wall on either side, of which one was half in"
1448 "ruins. Above this rose the arch of an old window thickly"
1448 "overgrown with ivy, which spread over the remains of a domed"
1448 "roof that had evidently been part of a chapel. A large hall came"
1448 "next, which lay open, without doors, to the square outside. Here"
1448 "also walls and roof only partially remained, and indeed what was"
1448 "left of the roof looked as if it might fall at any minute had it"
1448 "not been for two stout pillars that supported it. Alm-Uncle had"
1448 "here put up a wooden partition and covered the floor with straw,"
1448 "for this was to be the goats' house. Endless passages led from"
1448 "this, through the rents of which the sky as well as the fields"
1448 "and the road outside could be seen at intervals; but at last one"
1448 "came to a stout oak door that led into a room that still stood"
1448 "intact. Here the walls and the dark wainscoting remained as good"
1448 "as ever, and in the corner was an immense stove reaching nearly"
1448 "to the ceiling, on the white tiles of which were painted large"
1448 "pictures in blue. These represented old castles surrounded with"
1448 "trees, and huntsmen riding out with their hounds; or else a quiet"
1448 "lake scene, with broad oak trees and a man fishing. A seat ran"
1448 "all round the stove so that one could sit at one's ease and study"
1448 "the pictures. These attracted Heidi's attention at once, and she"
1448 "had no sooner arrived with her grandfather than she ran and"
1448 "seated herself and began to examine them. But when she had"
1448 "gradually worked herself round to the back, something else"
1448 "diverted her attention. In the large space between the stove and"
1448 "the wall four planks had been put together as if to make a large"
1448 "receptacle for apples; there were no apples, however, inside, but"
1448 "something Heidi had no difficulty in recognising, for it was her"
1448 "very own bed, with its hay mattress and sheets, and sack for a"
1448 "coverlid, just as she had it up at the hut. Heidi clapped her"
1448 "hands for joy and exclaimed, \"O grandfather, this is my room, how"
1448 "nice! But where are you going to sleep?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Your room must be near the stove or you will freeze,\" he"
1448 "replied, \"but you can come and see mine too.\""

1448 "Heidi got down and skipped across the large room after her"
1448 "grandfather, who opened a door at the farther end leading into a"
1448 "smaller one which was to be his bedroom. Then came another door."
1448 "Heidi pushed it open and stood amazed, for here was an immense"
1448 "room like a kitchen, larger than anything of the kind that Heidi"
1448 "had seen before. There was still plenty of work for the"
1448 "grandfather before this room could be finished, for there were"
1448 "holes and cracks in the walls through which the wind whistled,"
1448 "and yet he had already nailed up so many new planks that it"
1448 "looked as if a lot of small cupboards had been set up round the"
1448 "room. He had, however, made the large old door safe with many"
1448 "screws and nails, as a protection against the outside air, and"
1448 "this was very necessary, for just beyond was a mass of ruined"
1448 "buildings overgrown with tall weeds, which made a dwelling-place"
1448 "for endless beetles and lizards."

1448 "Heidi slept soundly in her corner by the stove; but every"
1448 "morning when she first awoke she still thought she was on the"
1448 "mountain, and that she must run outside at once to see if the fir"
1448 "trees were so quiet because their branches were weighed down with"
1448 "the thick snow. She had to look about her for some minutes before"
1448 "she felt quite sure where she was, and a certain sensation of"
1448 "trouble and oppression would come over her as she grew aware that"
1448 "she was not at home in the hut. But then she would hear her"
1448 "grandfather's voice outside, attending to the goats, and these"
1448 "would give one or two loud bleats, as if calling to her to make"
1448 "haste and go to them, and then Heidi was happy again, for she"
1448 "knew she was still at home, and she would jump gladly out of bed"
1448 "and run out to the animals as quickly as she could. On the fourth"
1448 "morning, as soon as she saw her grandfather, she said, \"I must go"
1448 "up to see grandmother to-day; she ought not to be alone so long.\""
1448 ""
1448 "But the grandfather would not agree to this. \"Neither to-day nor"
1448 "to-morrow can you go,\" he said; \"the mountain is covered fathom-"
1448 "deep in snow, and the snow is still falling; the sturdy Peter can"
1448 "hardly get along. A little creature like you would soon be"
1448 "smothered by it, and we should not be able to find you again."
1448 "Wait a bit till it freezes, then you will be able to walk over"
1448 "the hard snow.\""

1448 "and eagerly set to work to learn all that was taught her. She"
1448 "hardly ever saw Peter there, for as a rule he was absent. The"
1448 "teacher was an easy-going man who merely remarked now and then,"
1448 "\"Peter is not turning up to-day again, it seems, but there is a"
1448 "lot of snow up on the mountain and I daresay he cannot get"
1448 "along.\" Peter, however, always seemed able to make his way"
1448 "through the snow in the evening when school was over, and he"
1448 "then generally paid Heidi a visit."
1448 ""
1448 "At last, after some days, the sun again appeared and shone"
1448 "brightly over the white ground, but he went to bed again behind"
1448 "the mountains at a very early hour, as if he did not find such"
1448 "pleasure in looking down on the earth as when everything was"
1448 "green and flowery. But then the moon came out clear and large"
1448 "and lit up the great white snowfield all through the night, and"
1448 "the next morning the whole mountain glistened and sparkled like a"
1448 "huge crystal. When Peter got out of his window as usual, he was"
1448 "taken by surprise, for instead of sinking into the soft snow he"
1448 "fell on the hard ground and went sliding some way down the"
1448 "mountain side like a sleigh before he could stop himself. He"
1448 "picked himself up and tested the hardness of the ground by"
1448 "stamping on it and trying with all his might to dig his heels"
1448 "into it, but even then he could not break off a single little"
1448 "splinter of ice; the Alm was frozen hard as iron. This was just"
1448 "what Peter had been hoping for, as he knew now that Heidi would"
1448 "be able to come up to them. He quickly got back into the house,"
1448 "swallowed the milk which his mother had put ready for him,"
1448 "thrust a piece of bread in his pocket, and said, \"I must be off"
1448 "to school.\" \"That's right, go and learn all you can,\" said the"
1448 "grandmother encouragingly. Peter crept through the window again--"
1448 "the door was quite blocked by the frozen snow outside--pulling"
1448 "his little sleigh after him, and in another minute was shooting"
1448 "down the mountain."
1448 ""
1448 "He went like lightning, and when he reached Dorfli, which stood"
1448 "on the direct road to Mayenfeld, he made up his mind to go on"
1448 "further, for he was sure he could not stop his rapid descent"
1448 "without hurting himself and the sleigh too. So down he still"
1448 "went till he reached the level ground, where the sleigh came to a"
1448 "pause of its own accord. Then he got out and looked round. The"
1448 "impetus with which he had made his journey down had carried him"
1448 "some little way beyond Mayenfeld. He bethought himself that it"
1448 "was too late to get to school now, as lessons would already have"
1448 "begun, and it would take him a good hour to walk back to Dorfli."
1448 "So he might take his time about returning, which he did, and"
1448 "reached Dorfli just as Heidi had got home from school and was"
1448 "sitting at dinner with her grandfather. Peter walked in, and as"
1448 "on this occasion he had something particular to communicate, he"
1448 "began without a pause, exclaiming as he stood still in the"
1448 "middle of the room, \"She's got it now.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Got it? what?\" asked the Uncle. \"Your words sound quite"
1448 "warlike, general.\""

1448 "\"Oh! then now I can go and see grandmother!\" said Heidi"
1448 "joyfully, for she had understood Peter's words at once. \"But why"
1448 "were you not at school then? You could have come down in the"
1448 "sleigh,\" she added reproachfully, for it did not agree with"
1448 "Heidi's ideas of good behavior to stay away when it was possible"
1448 "to be there."
1448 ""
1448 "\"It carried me on too far and I was too late,\" Peter replied."
1448 ""
1448 "\"I call that being a deserter,\" said the Uncle, \"and deserters"
1448 "get their ears pulled, as you know.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter gave a tug to his cap in alarm, for there was no one of"
1448 "whom he stood in so much awe as Alm-Uncle."
1448 ""
1448 "\"And an army leader like yourself ought to be doubly ashamed of"
1448 "running away,\" continued Alm-Uncle. \"What would you think of"
1448 "your goats if one went off this way and another that, and refused"
1448 "to follow and do what was good for them? What would you do then?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I should beat them,\" said Peter promptly."
1448 ""
1448 "\"And if a boy behaved like these unruly goats, and he got a"
1448 "beating for it, what would you say then?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Serve him right,\" was the answer."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Good, then understand this: next time you let your sleigh carry"
1448 "you past the school when you ought to be inside at your lessons,"
1448 "come on to me afterwards and receive what you deserve.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter now understood the drift of the old man's questions and"
1448 "that he was the boy who behaved like the unruly goats, and he"
1448 "looked somewhat fearfully towards the corner to see if anything"
1448 "happened to be there such as he used himself on such occasions"
1448 "for the punishment of his animals."
1448 ""
1448 "But now the grandfather suddenly said in a cheerful voice, \"Come"
1448 "and sit down and have something, and afterwards Heidi shall go"
1448 "with you. Bring her back this evening and you will find supper"
1448 "waiting for you here.\""
1448 ""
1448 "This unexpected turn of conversation set Peter grinning all over"
1448 "with delight. He obeyed without hesitation and took his seat"
1448 "beside Heidi. But the child could not eat any more in her"
1448 "excitement at the thought of going to see grandmother. She"
1448 "pushed the potatoes and toasted cheese which still stood on her"
1448 "plate towards him while Uncle was filling his plate from the"
1448 "other side, so that he had quite a pile of food in front of him,"
1448 "but he attacked it without any lack of courage. Heidi ran to the"
1448 "cupboard and brought out the warm cloak Clara had sent her; with"
1448 "this on and the hood drawn over her head, she was all ready for"
1448 "her journey. She stood waiting beside Peter, and as soon as his"
1448 "last mouthful had disappeared she said, \"Come along now.\" As the"
1448 "two walked together Heidi had much to tell Peter of her two"
1448 "goats that had been so unhappy the first day in their new stall"
1448 "that they would not eat anything, but stood hanging their heads,"
1448 "not even rousing themselves to bleat. And when she asked her"
1448 "grandfather the reason of this, he told her it was with them as"
1448 "with her in Frankfurt, for it was the first time in their lives"
1448 "they had come down from the mountain. \"And you don't know what"
1448 "that is, Peter, unless you have felt it yourself,\" added Heidi."
1448 ""
1448 "The children had nearly reached their destination before Peter"
1448 "opened his mouth; he appeared to be so sunk in thought that he"
1448 "hardly heard what was said to him. As they neared home, however,"
1448 "he stood still and said in a somewhat sullen voice, \"I had"
1448 "rather go to school even than get what Uncle threatened.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi was of the same mind, and encouraged him in his good"
1448 "intention. They found Brigitta sitting alone knitting, for the"
1448 "grandmother was not very well and had to stay the day in bed on"
1448 "account of the cold. Heidi had never before missed the old"
1448 "figure in her place in the corner, and she ran quickly into the"
1448 "next room. There lay grandmother on her little poorly covered"
1448 "bed, wrapped up in her warm grey shawl."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Thank God,\" she exclaimed as Heidi came running in; the poor"
1448 "old woman had had a secret fear at heart all through the autumn,"
1448 "especially if Heidi was absent for any length of time, for Peter"
1448 "had told her of a strange gentleman who had come from Frankfurt,"
1448 "and who had gone out with them and always talked to Heidi, and"
1448 "she had felt sure he had come to take her away again. Even when"
1448 "she heard he had gone off alone, she still had an idea that a"
1448 "messenger would be sent over from Frankfurt to fetch the child."
1448 "Heidi went up to the side of the bed and said, \"Are you very"
1448 "ill, grandmother?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"No, no, child,\" answered the old woman reassuringly, passing"
1448 "her hand lovingly over the child's head, \"It's only the frost"
1448 "that has got into my bones a bit.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Shall you be quite well then directly it turns warm again?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, God willing, or even before that, for I want to get back"
1448 "to my spinning; I thought perhaps I should do a little to-day,"
1448 "but to-morrow I am sure to be all right again.\" The old woman had"
1448 "detected that Heidi was frightened and was anxious to set her"
1448 "mind at ease."
1448 ""
1448 "Her words comforted Heidi, who had in truth been greatly"
1448 "distressed, for she had never before seen the grandmother ill in"
1448 "bed. She now looked at the old woman seriously for a minute or"
1448 "two, and then said, \"In Frankfurt everybody puts on a shawl to"
1448 "go out walking; did you think it was to be worn in bed,"
1448 "grandmother?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I put it on, dear child, to keep myself from freezing, and I am"
1448 "so pleased with it, for my bedclothes are not very thick,\" she"
1448 "answered."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But, grandmother,\" continued Heidi, \"your bed is not right,"
1448 "because it goes downhill at your head instead of uphill.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"I know it, child, I can feel it,\" and the grandmother put up"
1448 "her hand to the thin flat pillow, which was little more than a"
1448 "board under her head, to make herself more comfortable; \"the"
1448 "pillow was never very thick, and I have lain on it now for so"
1448 "many years that it has grown quite flat.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, if only I had asked Clara to let me take away my Frankfurt"
1448 "bed,\" said Heidi. \"I had three large pillows, one above the"
1448 "other, so that I could hardly sleep, and I used to slip down to"
1448 "try and find a flat place, and then I had to pull myself up"
1448 "again, because it was proper to sleep there like that. Could you"
1448 "sleep like that, grandmother?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, yes! the pillows keep one warm, and it is easier to breathe"
1448 "when the head is high,\" answered the grandmother, wearily"
1448 "raising her head as she spoke as if trying to find a higher"
1448 "resting-place. \"But we will not talk about that, for I have so"
1448 "much that other old sick people are without for which I thank"
1448 "God; there is the nice bread I get every day, and this warm"
1448 "wrap, and your visits, Heidi. Will you read me something to-day?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi ran into the next room to fetch the hymn book. Then she"
1448 "picked out the favorite hymns one after another, for she knew"
1448 "them all by heart now, as pleased as the grandmother to hear"
1448 "them again after so many days. The grandmother lay with folded"
1448 "hands, while a smile of peace stole over the worn, troubled face,"
1448 "like one to whom good news has been brought."
1448 ""
1448 "Suddenly Heidi paused. \"Grandmother, are you feeling quite well"
1448 "again already?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, child, I have grown better while listening to you; read it"
1448 "to the end.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The child read on, and when she came to the last words:--"
1448 ""
1448 "As the eyes grow dim, and darkness Closes round, the soul grows"
1448 "clearer,  Sees the goal to which it travels,  Gladly feels its"
1448 "home is nearer.\""
1448 ""
1448 "the grandmother repeated them once or twice to herself, with a"
1448 "look of happy expectation on her face. And Heidi took equal"
1448 "pleasure in them, for the picture of the beautiful sunny day of"
1448 "her return home rose before her eyes, and she exclaimed"
1448 "joyfully, \"Grandmother, I know exactly what it is like to go"
1448 "home.\" The old woman did not answer, but she had heard Heidi's"
1448 "words, and the expression that had made the child think she was"
1448 "better remained on her face."
1448 ""
1448 "A little later Heidi said, \"It is growing dark and I must go"
1448 "home; I am glad to think, that you are quite well again.\""
1448 ""
1448 "The grandmother took the child's hand in hers and held it"
1448 "closely. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I feel quite happy again; even if I"
1448 "have to go on lying here, I am content. No one knows what it is"
1448 "to lie here alone day after day, in silence and darkness,"
1448 "without hearing a voice or seeing a ray of light. Sad thoughts"
1448 "come over me, and I do not feel sometimes as if I could bear it"
1448 "any longer or as if it could ever be light again. But when you"
1448 "come and read those words to me, then I am comforted and my heart"
1448 "rejoices once more.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then she let the child go, and Heidi ran into the next room, and"
1448 "bid Peter come quickly, for it had now grown quite dark. But"
1448 "when they got outside they found the moon shining down on the"
1448 "white snow and everything as clear as in the daylight. Peter got"
1448 "his sleigh, put Heidi at the back, he himself sitting in front to"
1448 "guide, and down the mountain they shot like two birds darting"
1448 "through the air."

1448 "When Heidi was lying that night on her high bed of hay she"
1448 "thought of the grandmother on her low pillow, and of all she had"
1448 "said about the light and comfort that awoke in her when she"
1448 "heard the hymns, and she thought: if I could read to her every"
1448 "day, then I should go on making her better. But she knew that it"
1448 "would be a week, if not two, before she would be able to go up"
1448 "the mountain again. This was a thought of great trouble to Heidi,"
1448 "and she tried hard to think of some way which would enable the"
1448 "grandmother to hear the words she loved every day. Suddenly an"
1448 "idea struck her, and she was so delighted with it that she could"
1448 "hardly bear to wait for morning, so eager was she to begin"
1448 "carrying out her plan. All at once she sat upright in her bed,"
1448 "for she had been so busy with her thoughts that she had"
1448 "forgotten to say her prayers, and she never now finished her day"

1448 "in you altogether, Peter. Whereas formerly you often missed"
1448 "coming to school for a week, or even weeks at a time, you have"

1448 "get over her surprise at her son's attainment, and when the"
1448 "reader was in bed would often express her pleasure at it. \"Now he"

1448 "thankful when spring is here again and Heidi can come; they are"
1448 "not like the same hymns when Peter reads them. So many words"
1448 "seem missing, and I try to think what they ought to be and then I"
1448 "lose the sense, and so the hymns do not come home to my heart as"
1448 "when Heidi reads them.\""

1448 "The truth was that Peter arranged to make his reading as little"
1448 "troublesome for himself as possible. When he came upon a word"
1448 "that he thought was too long or difficult in any other way, he"
1448 "left it out, for he decided that a word or two less in a verse,"
1448 "where there were so many of them, could make no difference to"

1448 ""
1448 "It was the month of May. From every height the full fresh"
1448 "streams of spring were flowing down into the valley. The clear"
1448 "warm sunshine lay upon the mountain, which had turned green"
1448 "again. The last snows had disappeared and the sun had already"
1448 "coaxed many of the flowers to show their bright heads above the"
1448 "grass. Up above the gay young wind of spring was singing through"
1448 "the fir trees, and shaking down the old dark needles to make room"
1448 "for the new bright green ones that were soon to deck out the"
1448 "trees in their spring finery. Higher up still the great bird went"
1448 "circling round in the blue ether as of old, while the golden"
1448 "sunshine lit up the grandfather's hut, and all the ground about"
1448 "it was warm and dry again so that one might sit out where one"
1448 "liked. Heidi was at home again on the mountain, running backwards"
1448 "and forwards in her accustomed way, not knowing which spot was"
1448 "most delightful. Now she stood still to listen to the deep,"
1448 "mysterious voice of the wind, as it blew down to her from the"
1448 "mountain summits, coming nearer and nearer and gathering strength"
1448 "as it came, till it broke with force against the fir trees,"
1448 "bending and shaking them, and seeming to shout for joy, so that"
1448 "she too, though blown about like a feather, felt she must join in"
1448 "the chorus of exulting sounds. Then she would run round again to"
1448 "the sunny space in front of the hut, and seating herself on the"
1448 "ground would peer closely into the short grass to see how many"
1448 "little flower cups were open or thinking of opening. She rejoiced"
1448 "with all the myriad little beetles and winged insects that jumped"
1448 "and crawled and danced in the sun, and drew in deep draughts of"
1448 "the spring scents that rose from the newly-awakened earth, and"
1448 "thought the mountain was more beautiful than ever. All the tiny"
1448 "living creatures must be as happy as she, for it seemed to her"
1448 "there were little voices all round her singing and humming in"
1448 "joyful tones, \"On the mountain! on the mountain!\""
1448 ""
1448 "From the shed at the back came the sound of sawing and chopping,"
1448 "and Heidi listened to it with pleasure, for it was the old"
1448 "familiar sound she had known from the beginning of her life up"
1448 "here. Suddenly she jumped up and ran round, for she must know"
1448 "what her grandfather was doing. In front of the shed door"
1448 "already stood a finished new chair, and a second was in course of"
1448 "construction under the grandfather's skilful hand."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Oh, I know what these are for,\" exclaimed Heidi in great glee."
1448 "\"We shall want them when they all come from Frankfurt. This one"
1448 "is for Grandmamma, and the one you are now making is for Clara,"
1448 "and then--then, there will, I suppose, have to be another,\""
1448 "continued Heidi with more hesitation in her voice, \"or do you"
1448 "think, grandfather, that perhaps Fraulein Rottenmeier will not"
1448 "come with them?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Well, I cannot say just yet,\" replied her grandfather, \"but it"
1448 "will be safer to make one so that we can offer her a seat if she"
1448 "does.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Heidi looked thoughtfully at the plain wooden chair without arms"
1448 "as if trying to imagine how Fraulein Rottenmeier and a chair of"

1448 "contemplation, \"Grandfather,\" she said, shaking her head"
1448 "doubtfully, \"I don't think she would be able to sit on that.\""

1448 "approached from above a whistling, calling, and other sounds"

1448 "apparently as pleased as she was to be among the heights again,"
1448 "for they leaped about and bleated for joy, pushing Heidi this way"
1448 "and that, each anxious to express his delight with some sign of"
1448 "affection. But Peter sent them flying to right and left, for he"
1448 "had something to give to Heidi. When he at last got up to her he"
1448 "handed her a letter."

1448 "bread and cheese on the top of it, and had forgotten it when he"
1448 "fetched Alm-Uncle's two goats; only when he had finished his"
1448 "bread and cheese at mid-day and was searching in the bag for any"
1448 "last crumbs did he remember the letter which lay at the bottom."

1448 "the mountains and the flowers and of the great silence up there"
1448 "far above all towns and the villages, and of the fresh delicious"
1448 "air, and often adds, 'No one can help getting well up there.' He"

1448 "minute you might fall into a crevasse, and how it was such steep"
1448 "climbing that you feared at every step to go slipping to the"
1448 "bottom, and that goats alone could make their way up without fear"
1448 "of being killed. She shuddered when she heard him tell of all"
1448 "this, and since then she has not been so enthusiastic about"
1448 "Switzerland as she was before. Fear has also taken possession of"
1448 "Tinette, and she also refuses to come. So grandmamma and I will"

1448 "last grew spangled with them she spoke aloud, \"Yes, I understand"
1448 "now why we feel so happy, and are not afraid about anything,"
1448 "because God knows what is good and beautiful for us.\" And the"
1448 "stars with their glistening eyes continued to nod to her till"

1448 "Not only were the nights of this month of May so clear and"

1448 "So May passed, everything growing greener and greener, and then"

1448 "Heidi, having finished her domestic duties, ran out with the"
1448 "intention of paying first a visit to the fir trees, and then"
1448 "going up higher to see if the bush of rock roses was yet in"
1448 "bloom, for its flowers were so lovely when standing open in the"
1448 "sun. But just as she was turning the corner of the hut, she gave"
1448 "such a loud cry that her grandfather came running out of the shed"

1448 "Uncle smiled. \"I know more from experience than training,\" he"

1448 "face of suffering that he had known long years before, the face"
1448 "of a man lying crippled on his couch of pain, and unable to move"
1448 "a limb. The man had been his Captain during the fierce fighting"
1448 "in Sicily; he had found him lying wounded and had carried him"
1448 "away, and after that the captain would suffer no one else near"

1448 "such trees before, with their tall, straight stems, and long"
1448 "thick branches growing thicker and thicker till they touched the"
1448 "ground. Even the grandmamma, who had followed the children, was"

1448 "most in these ancient trees: the lofty tops rising in their full"
1448 "green splendor towards the sky, or the pillar-like stems, with"
1448 "their straight and gigantic boughs, that spoke of such antiquity"
1448 "of age, of such long years during which they had looked down"

1448 "\"Yes, I know what it feels like,\" replied Heidi, who remembered"
1448 "the many days in Frankfurt when all her food used to seem to"
1448 "stick in her throat. Clara, however, could not understand it;"
1448 "the fact was that she had never in her life before spent a whole"
1448 "day in the open air, much less in such high, life-giving mountain"

1448 "sweetly-tasting butter was made, and had brought home a large"
1448 "pat, some of which he had now spread thickly on two good slices"
1448 "of bread. He stood and watched with pleasure while Clara and"

1448 "remembered having done before. The following day and the day"
1448 "after passed in the same pleasant fashion, and the third day"
1448 "there came a surprise for the children. Two stout porters came"
1448 "up the mountain, each carrying a bed on his shoulders with"
1448 "bedding of all kinds and two beautiful new white coverlids. The"
1448 "men also had a letter with them from grandmamma, in which she"
1448 "said that these were for Clara and Heidi, and that Heidi in"
1448 "future was always to sleep in a proper bed, and when she went"

1448 "So the grandfather went up and threw back the hay from Heidi's"
1448 "bed on to the great heap, and then with his help the beds were"

1448 "between them out of sheer affection. When they reached the spot"
1448 "where the goats usually pastured they were surprised to find them"
1448 "already feeding there, climbing about the rocks, and Peter with"
1448 "them, lying his full length on the ground."

1448 "\"I'll teach you another time to go by like that, you lazy"

1448 "after the chair and ascertain what had become of it."

1448 "The sky was dark blue, and not a single cloud was to be seen"
1448 "from one horizon to the other. The great snow-field overhead"
1448 "sparkled as if set with thousands and thousands of gold and"
1448 "silver stars. The two grey mountains peaks lifted their lofty"
1448 "heads against the sky and looked solemnly down upon the valley as"
1448 "of old; the great bird was poised aloft in the clear blue air,"
1448 "and the mountain wind came over the heights and blew refreshingly"
1448 "around the children as they sat on the sunlit slope. It was all"
1448 "indescribably enjoyable to Clara and Heidi. Now and again a"
1448 "young goat came and lay down beside them; Snowflake came"
1448 "oftenest, putting her little head down near Heidi, and only"
1448 "moving because another goat came and drove her away. Clara had"
1448 "learned to know them all so well that she never mistook one for"
1448 "the other now, for each had an expression and ways of its own."

1448 "Some hours went by, and Heidi began to think that she might just"
1448 "go over to the spot where all the flowers grew to see if they"
1448 "were fully blown and looking as lovely as the year before. Clara"
1448 "could not go until grandfather came back that evening, when the"
1448 "flowers probably would be already closed. The longing to go"
1448 "became stronger and stronger, till she felt she could not resist"

1448 "\"Would you think me unkind, Clara,\" she said rather"

1448 "looking--but wait--\" for an idea had come into Heidi's head. She"

1448 "\"There, now you will not be alone,\" said Heidi, giving the goat"
1448 "a little push to show her she was to lie down near Clara, which"
1448 "the animal quite understood. Heidi threw the leaves into Clara's"
1448 "lap, and the latter told her friend to go at once to look at the"
1448 "flowers as she was quite happy to be left with the goat; she"
1448 "liked this new experience. Heidi ran off, and Clara began to"
1448 "hold out the leaves one by one to Snowflake, who snoozled up to"
1448 "her new friend in a confiding manner and slowly ate the leaves"
1448 "from her hand. It was easy to see that Snowflake enjoyed this"
1448 "peaceful and sheltered way of feeding, for when with the other"
1448 "goats she had much persecution to endure from the larger and"
1448 "stronger ones of the flock. And Clara found a strange new"
1448 "pleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain side, her"
1448 "only companion a little goat that looked to her for protection."
1448 "She suddenly felt a great desire to be her own mistress and to be"
1448 "able to help others, instead of herself being always dependent as"
1448 "she was now. Many thoughts, unknown to her before, came crowding"
1448 "into her mind, and a longing to go on living in the sunshine, and"
1448 "to be doing something that would bring happiness to another, as"
1448 "now she was helping to make the goat happy. An unaccustomed"
1448 "feeling of joy took possession of her, as if everything she had"
1448 "ever known or felt became all at once more beautiful, and she"
1448 "seemed to see all things in a new light, and so strong was the"
1448 "sense of this new beauty and happiness that she threw her arms"
1448 "round the little goat's neck, and exclaimed, \"O Snowflake, how"
1448 "delightful it is up here! if only I could stay on for ever with"
1448 "you beside me!\""

1448 "Heidi had meanwhile reached her field of flowers, and as she"
1448 "caught sight of it she uttered a cry of joy. The whole ground in"
1448 "front of her was a mass of shimmering gold, where the cistus"
1448 "flowers spread their yellow blossoms. Above them waved whole"
1448 "bushes of the deep blue bell-flowers; while the fragrance that"
1448 "arose from the whole sunlit expanse was as if the rarest balsam"
1448 "had been flung over it. The scent, however, came from the small"
1448 "brown flowers, the little round heads of which rose modestly"
1448 "here and there among the yellow blossoms. Heidi stood and gazed"
1448 "and drew in the delicious air. Suddenly she turned round and"
1448 "reached Clara's side out of breath with running and excitement."
1448 "\"Oh, you must come,\" she called out as soon as she came in sight,"
1448 "\"it is more beautiful than you can imagine, and perhaps this"
1448 "evening it may not be so lovely. I believe I could carry you,"

1448 "am. Oh, if only I could walk!\""

1448 "looking down on the two children. He had been sitting and"
1448 "staring before him in the same way for hours, as if he could not"
1448 "make out what he saw. He had destroyed the chair so that the"
1448 "friend might not be able to move anywhere and that her visit"
1448 "might come to an end, and then a little while after she had"
1448 "appeared right up here under his very nose with Heidi beside her."
1448 "He thought his eyes must deceive him, and yet there she was and"
1448 "no mistake about it."

1448 "Heidi now looked up to where he was sitting and called out in a"
1448 "peremptory voice, \"Peter, come down here!\""

1448 "\"I don't wish to come,\" he called in reply."
1448 ""
1448 "\"But you are to, you must; I cannot do it alone, and you must"

1448 "\"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" was the answer."

1448 "called again, her eyes ablaze with anger, \"If you don't come at"
1448 "once, Peter, I will do something to you that you won't like; I"
1448 "mean what I say.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter felt an inward throe at these words, and a great fear"
1448 "seized him. He had done something wicked which he wanted no one"
1448 "to know about, and so far he had thought himself safe. But now"
1448 "Heidi spoke exactly as if she knew everything, and whatever she"
1448 "did know she would tell her grandfather, and there was no one he"
1448 "feared so much as this latter person. Supposing he were to"
1448 "suspect what had happened about the chair! Peter's anguish of"

1448 "was successfully carried through, but then came the difficulty."
1448 "As Clara could not even stand, how were they to support her and"
1448 "get her along? Heidi was too small for her arm to serve Clara to"
1448 "lean upon."
1448 ""
1448 "\"You must put one arm well around my neck so, and put the other"

1448 "\"That's not the way, Peter,\" said Heidi in an authoritative"
1448 "voice. \"You must put your arm out in the shape of a ring, and"
1448 "Clara must put hers through it and lean her weight upon you, and"
1448 "whatever you do, don't let your arm give way; like that. I am"
1448 "sure we shall be able to manage.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter did as he was told, but still they did not get on very"
1448 "well. Clara was not such a light weight, and the team did not"
1448 "match very well in size; it was up one side and down the other,"
1448 "so that the supports were rather wobbly."

1448 "Clara tried to use her own feet a little, but each time drew"
1448 "them quickly back."

1448 "\"Put your foot down firmly once,\" suggested Heidi, \"I am sure it"
1448 "will hurt you less after that.\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Do you think so?\" said Clara hesitatingly, but she followed"
1448 "Heidi's advice and ventured one firm step on the ground and then"
1448 "another; she called out a little as she did it; then she lifted"
1448 "her foot again and went on, \"Oh, that was less painful already,\""
1448 "she exclaimed joyfully."

1448 "\"Try again,\" said Heidi encouragingly."

1448 "delight, \"Can you really make steps, can you really walk? really"
1448 "walk by yourself? Oh, if only grandfather were here!\" and she"
1448 "continued gleefully to exclaim, \"You can walk now, Clara, you can"
1448 "walk!\""

1448 "Clara still held on firmly to her supports, but with every step"

1448 "\"Now we shall be able to come up here together every day, and go"
1448 "just where we like; and you will be able all your life to walk"

1448 "will get quite strong and well. It is the greatest happiness we"
1448 "could have had!\""

1448 "people, and no longer to have to lie from day to day in her"
1448 "invalid chair."

1448 "sun. As they came to the bushes of the blue bell flowers, with"
1448 "sunny, inviting patches of warm ground between them, Clara said,"
1448 "\"Mightn't we sit down here for a while?\""

1448 "fragrant prunella enveloped her as she sat. Everything was so"
1448 "lovely! so lovely! And Heidi, who was beside her, thought she"
1448 "had never seen it so perfectly beautiful up here before, and she"
1448 "did not know herself why she felt so glad at heart that she"
1448 "longed to shout for joy. Then she suddenly remembered that Clara"
1448 "was cured; that was the crowning delight of all that made life so"
1448 "delightful in the midst of all this surrounding beauty. Clara sat"
1448 "silent, overcome with the enchantment of all that her eye rested"
1448 "upon, and with the anticipation of all the happiness that was now"
1448 "before her. There seemed hardly room in her heart for all her"
1448 "joyful emotions, and these and the ecstasy aroused by the"
1448 "sunlight and the scent of the flowers, held her dumb."
1448 ""
1448 "Peter also lay among the flowers without moving or speaking, for"
1448 "he was fast asleep. The breeze came blowing softly and"
1448 "caressingly from behind the sheltering rocks, and passed"
1448 "whisperingly through the bushes overhead. Heidi got up now and"
1448 "then to run about, for the flowers waving in the warm wind"
1448 "seemed to smell sweeter and to grow more thickly whichever way"

1448 "It was long past noon when a small troop of goats advanced"
1448 "solemnly towards the plain of flowers. It was not a feeding"
1448 "place of theirs, for they did not care to graze on flowers. They"
1448 "looked like an embassy arriving, with Greenfinch as their leader."

1448 "left them in the lurch, and who had, contrary to all custom,"
1448 "remained away so long, for the goats could tell the time without"
1448 "mistake. As soon as Greenfinch caught sight of the three missing"
1448 "friends amid the flowers she set up an extra loud bleat,"
1448 "whereupon all the others joined in a chorus of bleats, and the"
1448 "whole company came trotting towards the children. Peter woke up,"
1448 "rubbing his eyes, for he had been dreaming that he saw the chair"
1448 "again with its beautiful red padding standing whole and uninjured"
1448 "before the grandfather's door, and indeed just as he awoke he"
1448 "thought he was looking at the brass-headed nails that studded it"
1448 "all round, but it was only the bright yellow flowers beside him."

1448 "this dream of the uninjured chair. Even though Heidi had promised"
1448 "not to do anything, there still remained the lively dread that"
1448 "his deed might be found out in some other way. He allowed Heidi"
1448 "to do what she liked with him, for he was reduced to such a state"

1448 "more practice in walking so that she might be able to go a"
1448 "little way by herself; above all things grandmamma was not to"

1448 "immediately sat down and wrote a pressing invitation to"
1448 "grandmamma, asking her to come soon, but no word was said about"
1448 "there being anything new to see."

1448 "to go about in a chair, I can walk by myself like other people.\""
1448 ""
1448 "Then came the walking, and every day she found it easier and was"
1448 "able to go a longer distance. The movement gave her such an"

1448 "thicker each day, and was well pleased to see it disappear. He"
1448 "now brought out with it a large jugful of the foaming milk and"
1448 "filled her little bowl over and over again. And so another week"

1448 "a great longing had seized him to see his little daughter from"
1448 "whom he had been separated the whole summer. He arrived at Ragatz"
1448 "a few hours after his mother had left. When he heard that she had"
1448 "that very day started for the mountain, he immediately hired a"

1448 "the hut lay perhaps on the other side of the mountain. He looked"
1448 "round to see if any one was in sight of whom he could ask the"
1448 "way; but far and wide there was not a soul to be seen or a sound"
1448 "to be heard. Only at moments the mountain wind whistled through"
1448 "the air, and the insects hummed in the sunshine or a happy bird"
1448 "sang out from the branches of a solitary larch tree. Herr"
1448 "Sesemann stood still for a while to let the cool Alpine wind blow"
1448 "on his hot face. But now some one came running down the mountain-"
1448 "side--it was Peter with the telegram in his hand. He ran straight"
1448 "down the steep slope, not following the path on which Herr"
1448 "Sesemann was standing. As soon as the latter caught sight of him"
1448 "he beckoned to him to come. Peter advanced towards him slowly and"
1448 "timidly, with a sort of sidelong movement, as if he could only"
1448 "move one leg properly and had to drag the other after him. \"Hurry"
1448 "up, lad,\" called Herr Sesemann, and when Peter was near enough,"
1448 "\"Tell me,\" he said, \"is this the way to the hut where the old man"

1448 "stranger who had asked him the way was the very man himself."
1448 "Just as he had rolled to the edge of that last high slope above"
1448 "Dorfli he was caught in a bush, and at last able to keep himself"

1448 "bed, so as to hide himself, for he felt safest when there. But he"
1448 "had left the goats up above, and Uncle had given him strict"

1448 "left to sit alone day after day for weeks, with nothing to do but"
1448 "brood over his wrongs. No, no, let us be fair to him; his anger"

1448 "\"Come here, boy, and stand in front of me, for I have something"
1448 "to say to you. Leave off shaking and trembling, for I want you"

1448 "that it was broken to pieces. That was a very wrong thing to do,"
1448 "as you yourself knew very well at the time, and you also knew"
1448 "that you deserved to be punished for it, and in order to escape"
1448 "this you have been doing all you can to hide the truth from"
1448 "everybody. But be sure of this, Peter: that those who do wrong"
1448 "make a mistake when they think no one knows anything about it."
1448 "For God sees and hears everything, and when the wicked doer"
1448 "tries to hide what he has done, then God wakes up a little"
1448 "watchman that He places inside us all when we are born and who"
1448 "sleeps on quietly till we do something wrong. And the little"
1448 "watchman has a small goad in his hand, And when he wakes up he"
1448 "keeps on pricking us with it, so that we have not a moment's"
1448 "peace. And the watchman torments us still further, for he keeps"
1448 "on calling out, 'Now you will be found out! Now they will drag"
1448 "you off to punishment!' And so we pass our life in fear and"
1448 "trouble, and never know a moment's happiness or peace. Have you"
1448 "not felt something like that lately, Peter?\""
1448 ""
1448 "Peter gave a contrite nod of the head, as one who knew all about"
1448 "it, for grandmamma had described his own feelings exactly."

1448 "\"And you calculated wrongly also in another way,\" continued"
1448 "grandmamma, \"for you see the harm you intended has turned out"
1448 "for the best for those you wished to hurt. As Clara had no chair"
1448 "to go in and yet wanted so much to see the flowers, she made the"
1448 "effort to walk, and every day since she has been walking better"
1448 "and better, and if she remains up here she will in time be able"
1448 "to go up the mountain every day, much oftener than she would"
1448 "have done in her chair. So you see, Peter, God is able to bring"
1448 "good out of evil for those whom you meant to injure, and you who"
1448 "did the evil were left to suffer the unhappy consequences of it."
1448 "Do you thoroughly understand all I have said to you, Peter? If"
1448 "so, do not forget my words, and whenever you feel inclined to do"
1448 "anything wrong, think of the little watchman inside you with his"
1448 "goad and his disagreeable voice. Will you remember all this?\""
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, I will,\" answered Peter, still very subdued, for he did"
1448 "not yet know how the matter was going to end, as the police"
1448 "constable was still standing with the Uncle."
1448 ""
1448 "\"That's right, and now the thing is over and done for,\" said"
1448 "grandmamma. \"But I should like you to have something for a"

1448 "The fact began at last to dawn upon Peter's mind that he had no"
1448 "further punishment to fear, and that the kind lady sitting in"
1448 "front of him had delivered him from the police constable. He"
1448 "suddenly felt as if the weight of a mountain had fallen off him."
1448 "He had also by this time awakened to the further conviction that"
1448 "it was better to make a full confession at once of anything he"
1448 "had done wrong or had left undone, and so he said, \"And I lost"
1448 "the paper, too.\""

1448 "Peter grew almost giddy with the thought that he could have"

1448 "lovely things that he had stood gazing at for hours, without a"
1448 "hope of ever possessing one of them, for Peter's purse never"
1448 "held more than a halfpenny, and all these fascinating objects"
1448 "cost double that amount. There were the pretty little red"
1448 "whistles that he could use to call his goats, and the splendid"
1448 "knives with rounded handles, known as toad-strikers, with which"
1448 "one could do such famous work among the hazel bushes."

1448 "Peter remained pondering; he was trying to think which of these"
1448 "two desirable objects he should best like to have, and he found"

1448 "request. Come here then!\" and she pulled out her purse and put"
1448 "four bright round shillings in his hand and, then laid some"
1448 "pennies on top of it. \"We will settle our accounts at once,\" she"
1448 "continued, \"and I will explain them to you. I have given you as"
1448 "many pennies as there are weeks in the year, and so every Sunday"
1448 "throughout the year you can take out a penny to spend.\""

1448 "\"As long as I live?\" said Peter quite innocently."
1448 ""
1448 "Grandmamma laughed more still at this, and the men hearing her,"
1448 "paused in their talk to listen to what was going on."
1448 ""
1448 "\"Yes, boy, you shall have it all your life--I will put it down"
1448 "in my will. Do you hear, my son? and you are to put it down in"
1448 "yours as well: a penny a week to Peter as long as he lives.\""

1448 "Herr Sesemann nodded his assent and joined in the laughter."
1448 ""
1448 "Peter looked again at the present in his hand to make sure he"
1448 "was not dreaming, and then said, \"Thank God!\""

1448 "And he went off running and leaping with more even than his"
1448 "usual agility, and this time managed to keep his feet, for it was"
1448 "not fear, but joy such as he had never known before in his life,"

1448 "all you have said, but I have need of nothing; I have enough for"
1448 "myself and the child as long as I live. One wish alone I have,"
1448 "and if that could be satisfied I should have no further care in"
1448 "life.\""

1448 "\"There could never be any question of such a thing as that, my"

1448 "upon it. I promise you: Heidi shall never have to go and earn her"

1448 "during my life and after. But now I have something else to say."
1448 "Independent of her circumstances, the child is totally unfitted"
1448 "to live a life away from home; we found out that when she was"
1448 "with us. But she has made friends, and among them I know one who"
1448 "is at this moment in Frankfurt; he is winding up his affairs"
1448 "there, that he may be free to go where he likes and take his"
1448 "rest. I am speaking of my friend, the doctor, who came over here"
1448 "in the autumn and who, having well considered your advice,"
1448 "intends to settle in this neighborhood, for he has never felt so"
1448 "well and happy anywhere as in the company of you and Heidi. So"
1448 "you see the child will henceforth have two protectors near her--"

1448 "house rebuilt for himself, the other part being repaired for"
1448 "Uncle and Heidi, for the doctor is aware that Uncle is a man of"
1448 "independent spirit, who likes to have a house to himself. Quite"
1448 "at the back a warm and well-walled stall is being put up for the"
1448 "two goats, and there they will pass their winter in comfort."

1448 "I have my rights in her, and shall look forward to her being with"
1448 "me and caring for me in my old age, which is the one great wish"
1448 "of my heart. She will have the same claims upon me as if she were"
1448 "my own child, and I shall provide for her as such, and so we"

1448 "And it was difficult to say which of the three looked the"
