# MA615-Text-Mining


## Choosing books
In this repository, I chose the Heidi as the dataset for text mining. I perform sentiment analysis on the dataset using sentiments from tidytext and inner_join() from dplyr. Then, I analyzed this book by words and by sentence, by using different sentiment measurement.
